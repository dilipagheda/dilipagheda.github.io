                    full stack application that will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing
                    information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses,
                    viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the
                    database.</p>

                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>This project is 7th project for Treehouse full stack Javascript techdegree. It is about creating an
                    image gallary app using React components, React routes and Fetch API. It fetches images from Flicker API
                    service. Users can also search the phrase (e.g., cat) and it will show images that matches the search phrase.
                    Yay!!
                </p>
                <h5>Project tasks:
                </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in your app.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter so that it can be deployed on Github pages without Errors and URLs always stay in sync with React Routes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
