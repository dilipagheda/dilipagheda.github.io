                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>This is the 10th and final project as part of Treehouse's Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree! It is the
                    full stack application that will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing
                    information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses,
                    viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the
                    database.</p>
                <p>In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the
                    database.
                </p>
