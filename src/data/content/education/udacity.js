            description: "In Feb 2019, I completed the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree through Udacity. I learnt more about HTML, CSS & JavaScript and various Frontend frameworks such as Angular, Ember and libraries like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Chart.js, Animate.css , jQuery and Testing frameworks like Jasmine. I also got deeper understanding of Web Accessibility and how to optimise the existing website to make it more accessible through screen readers."
