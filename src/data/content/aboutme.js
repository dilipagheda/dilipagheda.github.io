    "new flavours of teas :-) I am passionate about learning and applying digital technology to solve problems. I build, test and " +
    "deploy awesome apps that adds value to everyday lives. In my free time, I build side projects using web, mobile and backend " +
    "technologies. I continously learn and improve my skills through online coding bootcamps such as Treehouse and Udacity.",

    "I built this website initially using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap and Animate.CSS. This site " +
    "started off as my first project for Treehouse Frontend Techdegree and gradually evolved to a full-fledged website for the " +
    "last project. Later, I migrated the entire code to React and Redux to build a complete single page application (SPA) utilising " +
    "the global data store. This move made it so easy for me to update content quickly and thus make it more maintainable.",

    "This site is also my own little sandbox to experiment with new libraries and frameworks."]
