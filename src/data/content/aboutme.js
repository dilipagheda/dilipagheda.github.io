            Hello! I am Dilip Agheda. A Polyglot Programmer, Fullstack Web Developer and tea addict. I love building a variety of web stuff as much as trying
            new flavours of teas :-) I am passionate about using the power of digital technology to solve problems. I build, test and
            deploy awesome apps that adds value to everyday lives. In my free time, I build side projects using web, mobile and backend  
            technologies and also contribute voluntarily to community projects.
        </p>
        <p>
        I built this website initially using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap and Animate.CSS. This site  
        started off as my first project for Treehouse Frontend Techdegree and gradually evolved to a full-fledged website for the  
        last project. Later, I migrated the entire code to React and Redux to build a complete single page application (SPA) utilising  
        the global data store. This move made it so easy for me to update content quickly and thus make it more maintainable.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is also my own little sandbox to experiment with new libraries and frameworks.

                May 2019, I developed a Flutter app that implements an idea of enabling Aged Care Centers in Sydney to keep track of Quality Indicators
                for their residents. Quality Managers can enter data for their residents, how well they are doing and then submit it to backend system via API Integration.

                embedded Vimeo player in a modal and then also can make it a full screen.
