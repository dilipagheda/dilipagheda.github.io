                <p class="card-text">This project is developed as part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program. It is about consuming popular movies API and serving the content in a meaningful way to the user. Users see movies posters in a grid layout and can interact with the poster to learn more about the movie. Users can see movie details, reviews and trailers about the movie and can also mark the movie as favorite by starring it! All favorite movies are stored locally on the device in a database. Users can also choose to fetch movies differently based on a criteria.</p>

                      <p>
                          This project is about fetching movies data from popular movies API -https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/. Its documentation is found <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">Here!</a>

                          It shows movie posters in a grid view on the main screen. When user taps on any of the poster, it shows another screen with the movie details such as title, rating, plot synopsis etc. It also has a preferences where user can select the sort criteria by most popular vs highest rated. Once the sort criteria is changed, app makes new network call with different parameters and display movies accordingly. Users can also mark their movie as favorite and it gets stored in a local database. Users can also see trailers and reviews about the movie in real time. Overall, It is a fantastic app with a solid idea to consume the moviesDB API and present the information in a user-friendly way.

                          This project is done in two stages in an incremental manner. It was more complex than the last project (Sandwich club) and it took me 1 week to complete. There were several bits that required me to study more of Android such as making a network call using third party library (Retrofit 2), loading images using Picasso, organising bigger code in a better way, design multiscreen layout and above all start the brand new project from scratch! 


                      </p>

                      <p>
                          This project didn’t come with any starter code from Udacity and I was required to start from scratch with nothing. It was more challenging as I had to contemplate on which minimum and target API to choose, add dependancies in Gradle and start a completely new layout.


                      </p>

                      <p>
                          MainActivity has a Grid layout which loads movie posters in a two column grid layout. It is a ListView hooked up with an adapter that provides data. I used Picasso library so that it does fetching an image, loading to imageView and caching for free! I first started off with hard coded data in the adapter and got the GridView right in both portrait and landscape mode. Landscape mode has 3 columns as I created a new layout just for that. Once GridView was working properly, I implemented a network call using Retrofit 2 library and fetched only the first page. I spent a day to learn Retrofit and did a toy project first. After that, I incorporated it in this project and completed all plumbing between service response and UI. I used Loader pattern in MainActivity so that unnecessary calls are not made and no memory leaks happen during device rotation. At this point, app was 50% done except “Movie details” screen. I spent a day coding for ‘details’ screen which require a seperate layout file and activity. 


                      </p>

                      <p>
                          Last thing that was bugging me was pagination. Although, it was not part of the requirement but I chose to challenge myself and decided to implement it. I didn’t know how to use Android architecture components yet so I just implemented it by hand using OnScrollListener on ListView. Each time, user scrolls down and OnScrollListener is called and inside, I receive parameters which tells if its time to load a new page. I go ahead and make new network call with page=2 parameter. result is added on top of existing items in the Adapter. Eventually, Adapter builds bigger list of movies.


                      </p>

                      <p>
                          Project is done with all above items and now its time to test. with my testing background, I used Charles Proxy and inspected all calls including network failure, 500/404 response codes and empty state. It passed around 10+ test cases and I felt like it was time to submit. Next day, I got it reviewed and there were lot of ‘Awesome’ comments from the reviewer. Perfect! 


                      </p>

                      <p>In Stage 2 of the project, I used Android architecture components such as ViewModel, Paging, LiveData and Room. After the project is done with these, I can tell that app is production ready as it is now making use of robust and reusable android architecture components. Using these components gave app a nice structure and got rid of lot of boilerplate code. </p>
                      <p>As an application developer, it is more important to be productive and hit the target by writing production quality code. The goal is not to write networking code that handles socket connections or think about how to process images at the binary level. You want to use reliable and dependable libraries for handling such things. For this app, I wanted to accomplish exactly that so I first researched what’s the recommended library for networking and displaying images for Android in Java. On Google documentation, Retrofit 2 is recommended for network calls and so I used that one. For, displaying images , I picked up Picasso. It is very easy to integrate libraries in your code (as long as they are not buggy!). You include Gradle dependancy and just to Sync. and that’s it. You have all the code that other developers already spent months writing it.
                        </p>
                        <p>After you have written your networking code, how do you know if it works! You can put breakpoints and examine variables in your debugger and check if it is constructing right URL and including right query string parameters. In this app, there were two different endpoints used namely /top-rated and /most-popular.  The decision on which endpoint to connect to was based on user preferences. I found that it is much better to use Charles proxy and inspect request / responses there as it gives richer level of information. It also helped me to test things like pagination, network error, empty state and request timeouts.  
                          </p>
                          <p>This project was designed by Udacity with the purpose of giving exposure of Grid View, Multi-screen layout, taste of networking, processing JSON, displaying images, handling Async Tasks using Loader pattern etc. At the end of the project, I certainly felt more comfortable using these android concepts to build an app. During coding, I constantly had to refer to documentation and stack overflow which is great as it gives you assurance that where to go to when you get stuck.
