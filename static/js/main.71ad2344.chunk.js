It is about creating a travel planner app using HTML, CSS and plain Javascript , Node.js/Express and several public APIs.\n\nThe idea is that Node.js server will act as a middleware to protect the public API keys. Node server calls public APIs and fetches data which then gets transformed and sent back to front-end App. Front end app is written using plain javascript, SCSS, HTML which consumes this data and renders the information to user.\n\nThe fun part of this app is that user enters location such as Sydney and a travel date. App then displays country flag, country image, random facts about the country and weather information.\n\nIf the travel date is within next 7 days then only today's weather information is displayed.\n\nIf the travel date is beyond the 7 days then it shows today's weather and next 16 days's forecasted weather for the target location.\n\nThe goal of this project is also to practice with:\n- Setting up Webpack\n- Sass styles\n- Webpack Loaders and Plugins\n- Creating layouts and page design\n- Service workers\n- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls\n- Jest testing\n- Get the taste of Natural Language Processing\n\nIt also uses service workers for offline caching and webpack for setting up build process.\n\n## Public APIs used\n- Geonames\n- Weatherbit\n- Rest Countries\n- Pixabay\n\n\n# How to run this project locally\n\n- Clone this repo to your local\n- First run `npm install` in root folder\n\n## Client\n- Build your client using webpack prod config by running below command\n  `npm run build-prod`\n\n  This should create a `dist` folder with all the artefacts\n\n## Server\n- create `.env` file inside `./src/server`\n- enter below api keys for these public APIs.\n```\nGEONAMES_USERNAME=<YOUR API KEY>\nWEATHERBIT_APIKEY=<YOUR API KEY>\nPIXABAY_APIKEY=<YOUR API KEY>\n\n```\n- Now, switch your current directory to ./src/server and run `node index.js`\n- You should see the message on your server console as\n`Example app listening on port 3000!`\n- Now, go to browser and enter `https:localhost:3000`\n\n# Test coverage using JEST\n\n![img](/github-readme-images/travelplanner-js/jest_test_report.PNG)\n\n\n# Home page - Screenshot\n\n![img](/github-readme-images/travelplanner-js/travel_app_demo.gif)\n","reactnative-crm":'# reactnative-crm\n\n## Project demo\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/IOhLXEH31xs&t=1s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOhLXEH31xs&t=1s "React native - CRM app demo")\n',flashcards:'#  Flashcards\nThis repo consists of implementation of flashcards projects on different platforms and languages.

The aim is to build a react app that provides a delightful experience to the end user.\n\n## How to access this application\nThis web application is deployed on AWS S3 at the moment. You can access it via\n\nhttp://marvel-heroes-app.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/\n\n## How to run this project locally\nPlease follow below steps.\n\n1. Create a file called `keys.js` in src/Apis directory. This file should hold public and private keys of Marvel API as follows.\n\n```\nconst ApiKeys = {\n  privateKey:'<insert private key>',\n  publicKey:'<insert public key>'\n}\n\nexport default ApiKeys\n```\n\n2. Run `npm install` to from the project root to install all required npm packages.\n\n3. Run `npm run start` to run the application. Application can be accessible at `localhost:3000` URL.\n\n## App Optimisation\nI have optimised the app so that it preservers the state globally and does not make API calls unncessarily. \n\n1. In the home page, search input is debounced by 1 sec. so, app does not make API call on every key press. if user types 'aar' within 1 sec then app makes only one API call.\n2. In the details page, app does not make API calls to fetch comic details unless user expands a perticular comic in accordian. once expanded, app makes only one API call for that perticular comic. thereafter, if user expands the same comic then app doesn't make another API call as that state is preserved. \n\n## Error handling\n1. App handles the route that doesn't exist. so, if user types /abcdef then app shows error page.\n2. If API calls fails because of server error, then app redirects to the error page and also prints logs on console.\n\n## State management\n- I have used global state using Context API and hooks to keep the characters data along with pagination information.\n- All other state is implemented as local to a perticular component where required.\n\n## Styling\n- I have used saas for writing css. Each component will have its own sass file and only that file will be imported to that component.\n- The application is responsive and caters for mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints.\n\n## Demo\n![](https://github.com/dilipagheda/marvel-heroes-app/blob/master/demo/marvel_app_demo.gif)\n","serverless-expense-tracker":"# Serverless Expense Tracker\n## Capstone Project\n### Udacity AWS Cloud Developer Nanodegree\n\n# How to access it live\n\nPlese go to this URL to access the live deployment\nhttp://expense-tracker-client-app.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com\n\nYou need to login first.

It is about building a simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework.\n\n# Functionality of the application\n\nThis application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.\n\nThe application also has authentication implemented using third partry OAuth provider called Auth0. User can sign-in using a Google account via Auth0 or can create a new user account.\n\n# Screenshots\n\n## React client homepage\n\n![](/github-readme-images/serverless-app/homepage.PNG)\n\n\n## AWS X-ray End to end Tracing from API gateway to Lamda invocation\n\n![](/github-readme-images/serverless-app/xraymapping.PNG)\n\n# TODO items\n\nThe application stores TODO items, and each TODO item contains the following fields:\n\n* `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item\n* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created\n* `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")\n* `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed\n* `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise\n* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item\n\nIt also stores an id of a user who created a TODO item.\n\n\n# Functions implemented\n\nfollowing functions are implemented and configured in the `serverless.yml` file:\n\n* `Auth` - this function should implement a custom authorizer for API Gateway that should be added to all other functions.\n\n* `GetTodos` - should return all TODOs for a current user. A user id can be extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend\n\nIt should return data that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  "items": [\n    {\n      "todoId": "123",\n      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",\n      "name": "Buy milk",\n      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",\n      "done": false,\n      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"\n    },\n    {\n      "todoId": "456",\n      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",\n      "name": "Send a letter",\n      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",\n      "done": true,\n      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n* `CreateTodo` - should create a new TODO for a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `CreateTodoRequest.ts` file\n\nIt receives a new TODO item to be created in JSON format that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",\n  "name": "Buy milk",\n  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",\n  "done": false,\n  "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"\n}\n```\n\nIt should return a new TODO item that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  "item": {\n    "todoId": "123",\n    "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",\n    "name": "Buy milk",\n    "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",\n    "done": false,\n    "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* `UpdateTodo` - should update a TODO item created by a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `UpdateTodoRequest.ts` file\n\nIt receives an object that contains three fields that can be updated in a TODO item:\n\n```json\n{\n  "name": "Buy bread",\n  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",\n  "done": true\n}\n```\n\nThe id of an item that should be updated is passed as a URL parameter.\n\nIt should return an empty body.\n\n* `DeleteTodo` - should delete a TODO item created by a current user. Expects an id of a TODO item to remove.\n\nIt should return an empty body.\n\n* `GenerateUploadUrl` - returns a pre-signed URL that can be used to upload an attachment file for a TODO item.\n\nIt should return a JSON object that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  "uploadUrl": "https://s3-bucket-name.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/image.png"\n}\n```\n\nAll functions are connected to appropriate events from API Gateway.\n\nAn id of a user can be extracted from a JWT token passed by a client.\n\nAny necessary resources are created in the `resources` section of the `serverless.yml` file such as DynamoDB table and S3 bucket.\n\n\n# Frontend\n\nThe `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API.\n\nThis frontend works with this serverless application. The `config.ts` file in the `client` folder contains an API endpoint and Auth0 configuration:\n\n```ts\nconst apiId = \'...\' API Gateway id\nexport const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`\n\nexport const authConfig = {\n  domain: \'...\',    // Domain from Auth0\n  clientId: \'...\',  // Client id from an Auth0 application\n  callbackUrl: \'http://localhost:3000/callback\'\n}\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\n- Auth0 application is created for Authentication via Auth0\n- App uses asymmetrically encrypted JWT tokens.\n\n# Best practices\n\nApp uses data layer and business application logic layer to seperate it from the infrastrucuture code so that in future seperate cloud provider can be used seamlessly.\n\n## Logging\n\nApp uses [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger that creates [JSON formatted](https://stackify.com/what-is-structured-logging-and-why-developers-need-it/) log statements. You can use it to write log messages like this:\n\n```ts\nimport { createLogger } from \'../../utils/logger\'\nconst logger = createLogger(\'auth\')\n\n// You can provide additional information with every log statement\n// This information can then be used to search for log statements in a log storage system\nlogger.info(\'User was authorized\', {\n  // Additional information stored with a log statement\n  key: \'value\'\n})\n```\n# Deployment\n\n- Install serverless framework\n\n- To deploy this app on AWS, simply run this command from the root folder.\n\n`sls deploy`\n\n\n# How to run the application\n\n## Backend\n\nTo deploy an application run the following commands:\n\n```\ncd backend\nnpm install\nsls deploy -v\n```\n\n## Frontend\n\nTo run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:\n\n```\ncd client\nnpm install\nnpm run start\n```\n\nThis should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.\n\n# Postman collection\n\nPostman collection is included for API testing.\n',udagram:"# Udagram - Instagram like App\n\nUdagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.\n\nThe project is split into two parts:\n1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework\n2. Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application\n\n## Deployment\nThis project is deployed on AWS - Kubernetes Cluster using Docker containers. Automated CI/CD pipeline is built using Travis CI.\n\n## Getting Started\n> _tip_: it's recommended that you start with getting the backend API running since the frontend web application depends on the API.\n\n### Prerequisite\n1. The depends on the Node Package Manager (NPM). You will need to download and install Node from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will allow you to be able to run `npm` commands.\n2. Environment variables will need to be set. These environment variables include database connection details that should not be hard-coded into the application code.\n#### Environment Script\nA file named `set_env.sh` has been prepared as an optional tool to help you configure these variables on your local development environment.\n \nWe do _not_ want your credentials to be stored in git. After pulling this `starter` project, run the following command to tell git to stop tracking the script in git but keep it stored locally. This way, you can use the script for your convenience and reduce risk of exposing your credentials.\n`git rm --cached set_env.sh`\n\nAfterwards, we can prevent the file from being included in your solution by adding the file to our `.gitignore` file.\n\n### Database\nCreate a PostgreSQL database either locally or on AWS RDS. Set the config values for environment variables prefixed with `POSTGRES_` in `set_env.sh`.\n\n### S3\nCreate an AWS S3 bucket. Set the config values for environment variables prefixed with `AWS_` in `set_env.sh`.\n\n### Backend API\n* To download all the package dependencies, run the command from the directory `udagram-api/`:\n    ```bash\n    npm install .\n    ```\n* To run the application locally, run:\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n* You can visit `http://localhost:8080/api/v0/feed` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a JSON payload. Feel free to play around with Postman to test the API's.\n\n### Frontend App\n* To download all the package dependencies, run the command from the directory `udagram-frontend/`:\n    ```bash\n    npm install .\n    ```\n* Install Ionic Framework's Command Line tools for us to build and run the application:\n    ```bash\n    npm install -g ionic\n    ```\n* Prepare your application by compiling them into static files.\n    ```bash\n    ionic build\n    ```\n* Run the application locally using files created from the `ionic build` command.\n    ```bash\n    ionic serve\n    ```\n* You can visit `http://localhost:8100` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a web interface.\n\n## Tips\n1. Take a look at `udagram-api` -- does it look like we can divide it into two modules to be deployed as separate microservices?\n2. The `.dockerignore` file is included for your convenience to not copy `node_modules`. Copying this over into a Docker container might cause issues if your local environment is a different operating system than the Docker image (ex. Windows or MacOS vs. Linux).\n3. It's useful to \"lint\" your code so that changes in the codebase adhere to a coding standard. This helps alleviate issues when developers use different styles of coding. `eslint` has been set up for TypeScript in the codebase for you. To lint your code, run the following:\n    ```bash\n    npx eslint --ext .js,.ts src/\n    ```\n    To have your code fixed automatically, run\n    ```bash\n    npx eslint --ext .js,.ts src/ --fix\n    ```\n4. Over time, our code will become outdated and inevitably run into security vulnerabilities. To address them, you can run:\n    ```bash\n    npm audit fix\n    ```\n5. In `set_env.sh`, environment variables are set with `export $VAR=value`. Setting it this way is not permanent; every time you open a new terminal, you will have to run `set_env.sh` to reconfigure your environment variables. To verify if your environment variable is set, you can check the variable with a command like `echo $POSTGRES_USERNAME`.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Docker Hub Images\n![](/github-readme-images/udagram/dockerhub_images.PNG)\n\n### Travis CI Build Passing\n![](/github-readme-images/udagram/travis_ci_build_passing.PNG)\n\n### Kubectl - Command output showing K8s Cluster, Pod and Services\n\n![](/github-readme-images/udagram/kubectl_commands_1.PNG)\n\n![](/github-readme-images/udagram/kubectl_commands_2.PNG)\n\n![](/github-readme-images/udagram/kubectl_commands_3.PNG)\n\n![](/github-readme-images/udagram/kubectl_commands_4.PNG)\n\n![](/github-readme-images/udagram/kubectl_commands_5.PNG)\n\n## Demo\n\n![](https://github.com/dilipagheda/udagram/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif)\n\n\n","image-filter-nodejs":"# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice\n\nUdagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree.

Initialize a new project: `npm i`\n2. run the development server with `npm run dev`\n\n### Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file\n\nThe starter code has a task for you to complete an endpoint in `./src/server.ts` which uses query parameter to download an image from a public URL, filter the image, and return the result.\n\nWe've included a few helper functions to handle some of these concepts and we're importing it for you at the top of the `./src/server.ts`  file.\n\n```typescript\nimport {filterImageFromURL, deleteLocalFiles} from './util/util';\n```\n\n### Deploying your system\n\nFollow the process described in the course to `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use `eb deploy` to push changes.\n\n## Stand Out (Optional)\n\n### Refactor the course RESTapi\n\nIf you're feeling up to it, refactor the course RESTapi to make a request to your newly provisioned image server.\n\n### Authentication\n\nPrevent requests without valid authentication headers.\n> !!NOTE if you choose to submit this, make sure to add the token to the postman collection and export the postman collection file to your submission so we can review!\n\n### Custom Domain Name\n\nAdd your own domain name and have it point to the running services (try adding a subdomain name to point to the processing server)\n> !NOTE: Domain names are not included in AWS\u2019 free tier and will incur a cost.\n","dinosaurs-js":"# Dinosaurs Infogram\n\nThis is the 1st project as part of Udacity Intermediate JS Nanodegree. Developed from scratch according to project rubric. It is about creating a Dinosaurs Infogram which compares the human data with predefined dinosaurs and displays in a nice grid format. The aim of the project is to practice writing plain JS using javascript design patterns such as IIFE, Module pattern, Revealing module pattern, constructor functions and prototypical inheritence.\n\n## Live URL Link\nhttp://dilipagheda.com/dinosaurs-js/index.html\n\n### Big Picture\n\nYou will be building an infographic that is derived from data that is provided, as well as user input data. Object-oriented javascript is great for working with complex data, but it\u2019s not of much use without an interface to interact with. You will be pulling in information from a form and using it to complete an array of objects that will then be appended back to the DOM. \n\nThis may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work. You\u2019ll need to plan out the logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin developing. If you find this process to be quick, there\u2019s a list of additional functionality that you can add that all strive to improve the users\u2019 experience. \n\nFor the project, you will generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, you will display the name of the human rather than species and no fact is necessary for the human. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed should be random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts (3 should be from the methods you create). One of the titles should be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, \u201cAll birds are considered dinosaurs.\u201d\n\n\n### Getting Started\n\nWe have supplied some of the foundational code for you. So follow these steps to get started:\n\n1. We'll start with the typical setup - clone theis repo and install the dependencies\n\n```git clone git@github.com:udacity/Javascript.git```\n\n2. Decide how you will work with classes, then build out your classes and objects. \n\n3. Get human data from the html form to build your human object. Think about what 3 things you are going to compare to your human. You may need to create more fields, adjust the fields that are there, or remove fields to correspond with the data you will be collecting. \n\n4. Create at least 3 methods that compare dino data to human data. Depending on how you decided to create your objects and what design pattern you chose, you may encounter issues accessing or working with some of the data. Do you need to create any functions to access/store this data?\n\n5. Generate tiles and append to the DOM. Each Dino title must include at least the species, an image and a fact. The dino fact displayed should be chosen at random from at least 6 options (including your 3 methods). The Human tile must include the user\u2019s name, and the human graphic--no fact is needed. The bird tile should include the species, image, and fact, \u201cAll birds are considered dinosaurs.\u201d\n\n6. Make certain the grid is not being added until you click the button to submit user data. Additionally, remove the form once the user has clicked to generate the infographic. It is a good idea to remove any calls to console.log at this point. \n\n7. REFACTOR. At this point, your code should be working properly. Ideally, refactoring happens while you are developing, but as a new developer, you often don\u2019t have the whole picture in your head to be able to do so properly.  Let\u2019s clean the project up. \n\n8. To preview the final version of your project online, commit the project to your github account. Access the index page at. https://github.com/path/to/project/index.html Copy that URL into https://htmlpreview.github.io/\n\n### Project Requirements\n\nTo complete this project, your UI must show the following:\n\n- [ ] The form should contain a button which upon clicking, removes the form\n- [ ] The button should append a grid with 9 tiles to the DOM with the Human located in the center\n- [ ] The Human tile should display the name of the person and an image, the dino tiles should contain the species, an image and a fact, the bird title should contain the species, image, and \"All birds are Dinosaurs.\"\n\n\nTo complete this project, your backend code must:\n\n- [ ] Contain a class and all necessary objects\n- [ ] Contain at least 3 methods for comparing dinosaurs to the human\n- [ ] Get user data from the DOM\n- [ ] Append tiles with object data to DOM\n\n### Above and Beyond\n\nThere's no extra credit in this course, but if you plan to use this project in your portfolio, you may enjoy taking this project further. \n\nSome ideas might be to validate the form data to ensure the data is acceptable and complete. Allow the user to generate a new infographic. Move the tile colors from CSS to JS for more control. Randomize the order of the tiles while keeping the human in the middle. Create a hover state on the tiles that displays the rest of the species statistics. Create additional methods for comparing data. Rewrite the project to use constructor functions, factory functions, the module pattern, and revealing module pattern. Change out data and images to generate an infographic of your own choosing. Allow the user to select different units for the numbers and update your methods to account for this. Make changes to the CSS, and HTML to make the project your own. \n\n\n### Version Control\n\nAlthough not a requirement, we recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our Git Style Guide.\n","mars-dashboard":"# Mars Dashboard\n\n### Big Picture\n\nThe aim of this project is to create a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. The dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. \n\n## Live URL link\nThe frontend for this app is deployed on github pages and backend node server is deployed on Heroku.\nUrl: https://dilipagheda.com/mars-dashboard/\n\n### Skills used\n- plain javascript\n- functional programming\n- Immutable.js\n- mutation observers\n- build React style SPA without using React framework !!!\n- reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses using pure functions and iterating over.\n- recursion\n- pure functions\n- dynamic event listeners\n\n# How to run this project locally\n\n- Clone this repo to your local\n- First run `npm install` in root folder\n\n## Client\n- Build your client using webpack prod config by running below command\n  `npm run build-prod`\n\n  This should create a `dist` folder with all the artefacts\n\n## Server\n- create `.env` file inside `./src/server`\n- enter API_KEY for NASA API as below:\n```\nAPI_KEY='<YOUR_API_KEY>'\n```\n- Now, switch your current directory to ./src/server and run `node index.js`\n- You should see the message on your server console as\n`Example app listening on port 3000!`\n- Now, go to browser and enter `https:localhost:3000`\n\n## How to get NASA API Key\n\nyou'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.\n\n\n## Project Features\n\n- UI show shows the following:\n\n- A gallery of the most recent images sent from each mars rover\n- The launch date, landing date, name and status along with any other information about the rover\n- A selection bar for the user to choose which rover's information they want to see\n- UI is responsive.\n- UI provides a way to dynamically switch the UI to view one of the three rovers \n\n## Technical aspects\n\nThis project is developed using plain javascript with functional programming style. It uses\n- only pure functions\n- at least one Higher Order Function\n- the array method `map`\n- the ImmutableJS library\n\n### Backend\n- built with Node/Express\n- makes successful calls to the NASA API\n- uses pure functions to do any logic necessary\n- hides any sensetive information from public view (In other words, use your dotenv file)\n\n### Future enhancements\n\n- More NASA APIs can be integrated\n\n\n\n","full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1":'# Full Stack App with React and a REST API :fire: :fire: :fire:\nThis is the 10th and final project as part of Treehouse\'s Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree!\nIt is the full stack application that will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.\n\nIn addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. \n\n## Technologies Used\n* React (Create-react-app)\n* Functional and Class based components\n* React Router to setup routes\n* Redux for global state management\n* Axios for API calls\n* Node.js , Express and MongoDB for API layer\n\n## How to run the project locally\nMake sure that your mongodb database is running.

Each course needs to link to its respective "Course Detail" screen. This component also renders a link to the "Create Course" screen.\n\n    * CourseDetail - This component provides the "Course Detail" screen by retrieving the detail for a course from the REST API\'s /api/courses/:id route and rendering the course. The component also renders a "Delete Course" button that when clicked should send a DELETE request to the REST API\'s /api/courses/:id route in order to delete a course. This component also renders an "Update Course" button for navigating to the "Update Course" screen.\n    \n    * UserSignIn - This component provides the "Sign In" screen by rendering a form that allows a user to sign using their existing account information. The component also renders a "Sign In" button that when clicked signs in the user and a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).\n    \n    * UserSignUp - This component provides the "Sign Up" screen by rendering a form that allows a user to sign up by creating a new account. The component also renders a "Sign Up" button that when clicked sends a POST request to the REST API\'s /api/users route and signs in the user. This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).\n    \n    * CreateCourse - This component provides the "Create Course" screen by rendering a form that allows a user to create a new course. The component also renders a "Create Course" button that when clicked sends a POST request to the REST API\'s /api/courses route. This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).\n    \n    * UpdateCourse - This component provides the "Update Course" screen by rendering a form that allows a user to update one of their existing courses. The component also renders an "Update Course" button that when clicked sends a PUT request to the REST API\'s /api/courses/:id route. This component also renders a "Cancel" button that returns the user to the "Course Detail" screen.\n    \n* Stateless functional components:\n    * Header- Displays the top menu bar for the application and includes buttons for signing in and signing up (if there\'s not an authenticated user) or the user\'s first and last name and a button for signing out (if there\'s an authenticated user).\n    \n    * UserSignOut - This component is a bit of an oddball as it doesn\'t render any visual elements. Instead, it signs out the authenticated user and redirects the user to the default route (i.e. the list of courses).\n#### Routes\n* Public Routes\n    * / - Courses\n    * /courses/:id - CourseDetail\n    * /signin - UserSignIn\n    * /signup - UserSignUp\n    * /signout - UserSignOut\n* Protected Routes\n    * /courses/create - CreateCourse\n    * /courses/:id/update - UpdateCourse\n\n## Screenshots\n### Sign up screen\n![Screenshot4](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/sign-up.png)\n### Sign in screen\n![Screenshot5](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/sign-in.png)\n### Home screen\n![Screenshot1](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/index.png)\n### Course Detail screen\n![Screenshot2](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/course-detail.png)\n### Update Detail screen\n![Screenshot3](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/update-course.png)\n### Error screens\n![Screenshot6](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/not-found.png)\n![Screenshot7](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/forbidden.png)\n![Screenshot8](/github-readme-images/full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api-v1/error.png)\n\n\n\n',"virtual-table":"## About the project - Virtual Table\n\nThis project is an example of react-virtualised library.

Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**\n\nIf you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.\n\nYou don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Learn More\n\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).\n\nTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting)\n\n### Analyzing the Bundle Size\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size)\n\n### Making a Progressive Web App\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app)\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration)\n\n### Deployment\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)\n\n### `npm run build` fails to minify\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)\n",WorldTour:"# WorldTour\n\nThis project is about interacting with various endpoints and show countries information in very engaging way.

In order for the database to be correctly\ncreated, you must meet the prerequisites below and change the connection strings to point to the MSSQL Server running on you your local PC.\n\n**Prerequisites**: MSSQL Server Standard 2017 or Express 2017 has been installed and Microsoft SQL Server Managament Studio has been installed).\n\n*Note: earlier versions of MSSQL Server should work fine, but have not been tested.\n\n*In the P3AddNewFunctionalityDotNetCore project, open the appsettings.json file.*\n\nYou will see the ConnectionStrings section which defines the connection strings for the 2 databases used in this application.\n\n\n      "ConnectionStrings":\n      {\n        "P3Referential": "Server=.;Database=P3Referential-2f561d3b-493f-46fd-83c9-6e2643e7bd0a;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true",\n        "P3Identity": "Server=.;Database=Identity;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"\n      }\n  \n\n**P3Referential** - connection string to the application database.\n\n**P3Identity** - connection string to the user database. This is a separate database as an organization will typically have many different applications. Rather\nthan have each application define its own users (and many different logins and passwords for a single user), the organization can have just one user database and use permissions and roles to define what applications the \nuser has access to. This way a user can access any of the organizations applications with the same login and password and will only be given access to databases and actions defined in the user database.\n\nThere are different versions of MSSQL (please use MSSQL for this project and not another database) and when setting up the database server, there are different options that will change the configuration, so the connection strings defined may not work.\n\nThe connection strings defined in the project are setup for MSSQL Server Standard 2017. The installation has not created an instance name, so the server is just referred to as "." which means the default instance of MSSQL server\nrunning on the current machine. The built in windows user which should be setup in MSSQL server by default during installation.\n\nIf you have installed MSSQL server express, the value to use for Server is most likely .\\SQLEXPRESS, so for example, your P3Referential connection string would be: -\n\n    "P3Referential": "Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=P3Referential-2f561d3b-493f-46fd-83c9-6e2643e7bd0a;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"\n\t\nIf you have trouble connecting, first try to connection using Microsoft SQL Server Managament Studio (make sure authentication type  is "Windows Authentication"), or refer to https://sqlserver-help.com/2011/06/19/help-whats-my-sql-server-name/.\nIf you still have trouble, please ask your mentor for assistance.\n',"oc-p2-shopping-app":"# A Shopping cart App - .NET Core MVC\n\nThis project is a shopping cart app built with ASP .NET Core MVC. It is a 2nd project as part of the OpenClassrooms - Backend developer path - .Net Core. \nThis project was given with all required unit tests. The unit tests were failing initially and goal was to implement the functionality so that unit tests will pass.\n\n# Skills used\n- ASP .NET Core, MVC\n- Unit tests\n- C#\n- Produce an xUnit test execution report\n- Fix an application according to a test execution report\n\n# Approach for solving this project\n\nI used below step by step approach for solving this project.\n\n1. I ran all unit tests and took the inital state of the test results.\n2. I ran the project and tested the application in the browser. I found issues (as mentioned in the issues/bugs section) and took a note of it.\n3. I started solving each bug one by one by debugging the code using debugger, founding a root cause and then implementing the functionality or fix.\n4. I noticed that at several places, functionality was not implemented at all. there were comments like 'To Do'. I implemented the functionality and then\n   re-ran unit tests. I noticed that more tests passed. I tested functionality in the browser and it worked.\n5. I repeated step 4 until all unit tests passed and functionality works 100% in the browser.\n\n# Issues/Bugs\nInitially, the project consisted of below bugs.\n1. Clicking on the 'Add to cart' button doesn't actually add a given product to the cart.\n2. Selecting a different language and clicking on 'Ok' button doesn't do anything.\n3. Once product started being added to the cart, cart didn't show the right Total Quantity and Average Quantity.\n4. Removing product from the cart wasn't working\n\n# Difficulties encountered\nDuring the course of this project, I encountered below difficulties and how I overcame it.\n1. When user clicked 'Add to cart' button, product was not being added to the cart. In order to fix this bug, I debugged the code and found where the issue was originating from.\nI noticed that in the Cart.cs, a property 'Lines' was assigned an expression which was creating a new list each time it was called. I figured that because of this, previous values of List was not being retained as new object is created each time. I fixed it using a singleton pattern where the expression creates new list only if it not created.\n2. Fixing the failing test - UpdateProductQuanties was very interesting. The fix involved registering repository classes as Singleton and also updating their constructor\n   so that we only create data once at the startup. I had to debug the unit test couple of times to fully understand what was going on. Debugging allowed me to understand\n   that data was not being preserved because each time, Repository was instantiated, it was resetting the data.\n\n# Test execution reports\n## Before\n```\nGroup Name: P2FixAnAppDotNetCode.Tests\nDuration: 0:00:00.05\n7 test(s) failed\n0 test(s) skipped\n1 test(s) passed\n```\n\n```\nPM> dotnet test\nTest run for C:\\Projects\\oc-p2-shopping-app\\P2FixAnAppDotNetCode.Tests\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0\\P2FixAnAppDotNetCode.Tests.dll(.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.0)\nMicrosoft (R) Test Execution Command Line Tool Version 16.3.0\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>\nYou need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won\u2019t see them.\n\nOnly files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>\nRead instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.\n\nYou can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>\nThey will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.\n\n## Available Scripts\n\nIn the project directory, you can run:\n\n### `npm start`\n\nRuns the app in the development mode.<br>\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload if you make edits.<br>\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\n\n### `npm test`\n\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>\nSee the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.\n\n### `npm run build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\n\nSee the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.\n\n### `npm run eject`\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can\u2019t go back!**\n\nIf you aren\u2019t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\u2019re on your own.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\u2019t be useful if you couldn\u2019t customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Supported Browsers\n\nBy default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.\n\nYou can refer [to the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support) for more information about supported browsers.\n\n## Supported Language Features and Polyfills\n\nThis project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard.<br>\nIn addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:\n\n* [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).\n* [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).\n* [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) (stage 3 proposal).\n* [Dynamic import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (stage 3 proposal)\n* [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (part of stage 3 proposal).\n* [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) syntax.\n\nLearn more about [different proposal stages](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets-stage-x-experimental-presets-).\n\nWhile we recommend using experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.\n\nNote that **the project only includes a few ES6 [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill)**:\n\n* [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) via [`object-assign`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign).\n* [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) via [`promise`](https://github.com/then/promise).\n* [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) via [`whatwg-fetch`](https://github.com/github/fetch).\n\nIf you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are including the appropriate polyfills manually, or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.\n\nAlso note that using some newer syntax features like `for...of` or `[...nonArrayValue]` causes Babel to emit code that depends on ES6 runtime features and might not work without a polyfill. When in doubt, use [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/) to see what any specific syntax compiles down to.\n\n## Syntax Highlighting in the Editor\n\nTo configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the [relevant Babel documentation page](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors) and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.\n\n## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.<br>\n>It also only works with npm 3 or higher.\n\nSome editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.\n\nThey are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.\n\nYou would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first. Then, add a file called `.eslintrc` to the project root:\n\n```js\n{\n  "extends": "react-app"\n}\n```\n\nNow your editor should report the linting warnings.\n\nNote that even if you edit your `.eslintrc` file further, these changes will **only affect the editor integration**. They won\u2019t affect the terminal and in-browser lint output. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.\n\nIf you want to enforce a coding style for your project, consider using [Prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier) instead of ESLint style rules.\n\n## Debugging in the Editor\n\n**This feature is currently only supported by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).**\n\nVisual Studio Code and WebStorm support debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don\u2019t have to switch between tools.\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nYou would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and VS Code [Chrome Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) installed.\n\nThen add the block below to your `launch.json` file and put it inside the `.vscode` folder in your app\u2019s root directory.\n\n```json\n{\n  "version": "0.2.0",\n  "configurations": [{\n    "name": "Chrome",\n    "type": "chrome",\n    "request": "launch",\n    "url": "http://localhost:3000",\n    "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/src",\n    "sourceMapPathOverrides": {\n      "webpack:///src/*": "${webRoot}/*"\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n>Note: the URL may be different if you\'ve made adjustments via the [HOST or PORT environment variables](#advanced-configuration).\n\nStart your app by running `npm start`, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified code\u2014all from your editor.\n\nHaving problems with VS Code Debugging? Please see their [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting).\n\n### WebStorm\n\nYou would need to have [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [JetBrains IDE Support](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-ide-support/hmhgeddbohgjknpmjagkdomcpobmllji) Chrome extension installed.\n\nIn the WebStorm menu `Run` select `Edit Configurations...`. Then click `+` and select `JavaScript Debug`. Paste `http://localhost:3000` into the URL field and save the configuration.\n\n>Note: the URL may be different if you\'ve made adjustments via the [HOST or PORT environment variables](#advanced-configuration).\n\nStart your app by running `npm start`, then press `^D` on macOS or `F9` on Windows and Linux or click the green debug icon to start debugging in WebStorm.\n\nThe same way you can debug your application in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, PyCharm Pro, and RubyMine. \n\n## Formatting Code Automatically\n\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, CSS and JSON. With Prettier you can format the code you write automatically to ensure a code style within your project. See the [Prettier\'s GitHub page](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for more information, and look at this [page to see it in action](https://prettier.github.io/prettier/).\n\nTo format our code whenever we make a commit in git, we need to install the following dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save husky lint-staged prettier\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add husky lint-staged prettier\n```\n\n* `husky` makes it easy to use githooks as if they are npm scripts.\n* `lint-staged` allows us to run scripts on staged files in git. See this [blog post about lint-staged to learn more about it](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/make-linting-great-again-f3890e1ad6b8).\n* `prettier` is the JavaScript formatter we will run before commits.\n\nNow we can make sure every file is formatted correctly by adding a few lines to the `package.json` in the project root.\n\nAdd the following line to `scripts` section:\n\n```diff\n  "scripts": {\n+   "precommit": "lint-staged",\n    "start": "react-scripts start",\n    "build": "react-scripts build",\n```\n\nNext we add a \'lint-staged\' field to the `package.json`, for example:\n\n```diff\n  "dependencies": {\n    // ...\n  },\n+ "lint-staged": {\n+   "src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css}": [\n+     "prettier --single-quote --write",\n+     "git add"\n+   ]\n+ },\n  "scripts": {\n```\n\nNow, whenever you make a commit, Prettier will format the changed files automatically. You can also run `./node_modules/.bin/prettier --single-quote --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css}"` to format your entire project for the first time.\n\nNext you might want to integrate Prettier in your favorite editor. Read the section on [Editor Integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) on the Prettier GitHub page.\n\n## Changing the Page `<title>`\n\nYou can find the source HTML file in the `public` folder of the generated project. You may edit the `<title>` tag in it to change the title from \u201cReact App\u201d to anything else.\n\nNote that normally you wouldn\u2019t edit files in the `public` folder very often. For example, [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) is done without touching the HTML.\n\nIf you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), a third party library.\n\nIf you use a custom server for your app in production and want to modify the title before it gets sent to the browser, you can follow advice in [this section](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server). Alternatively, you can pre-build each page as a static HTML file which then loads the JavaScript bundle, which is covered [here](#pre-rendering-into-static-html-files).\n\n## Installing a Dependency\n\nThe generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-router\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-router\n```\n\nThis works for any library, not just `react-router`.\n\n## Importing a Component\n\nThis project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.<br>\nWhile you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.\n\nFor example:\n\n### `Button.js`\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  render() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Button; // Don\u2019t forget to use export default!\n```\n\n### `DangerButton.js`\n\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\nimport Button from \'./Button\'; // Import a component from another file\n\nclass DangerButton extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <Button color="red" />;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default DangerButton;\n```\n\nBe aware of the [difference between default and named exports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.\n\nWe suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That\u2019s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from \'./Button\'`.\n\nNamed exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.\n\nLearn more about ES6 modules:\n\n* [When to use the curly braces?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281)\n* [Exploring ES6: Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html)\n* [Understanding ES6: Modules](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-encapsulating-code-with-modules)\n\n## Code Splitting\n\nInstead of downloading the entire app before users can use it, code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks which you can then load on demand.\n\nThis project setup supports code splitting via [dynamic `import()`](http://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html#loading-code-on-demand). Its [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) is in stage 3. The `import()` function-like form takes the module name as an argument and returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which always resolves to the namespace object of the module.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n### `moduleA.js`\n\n```js\nconst moduleA = \'Hello\';\n\nexport { moduleA };\n```\n### `App.js`\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  handleClick = () => {\n    import(\'./moduleA\')\n      .then(({ moduleA }) => {\n        // Use moduleA\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        // Handle failure\n      });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis will make `moduleA.js` and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the \'Load\' button.\n\nYou can also use it with `async` / `await` syntax if you prefer it.\n\n### With React Router\n\nIf you are using React Router check out [this tutorial](http://serverless-stack.com/chapters/code-splitting-in-create-react-app.html) on how to use code splitting with it. You can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-client/tree/code-splitting-in-create-react-app).\n\nAlso check out the [Code Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) section in React documentation.\n\n## Adding a Stylesheet\n\nThis project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of \u201cextending\u201d the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:\n\n### `Button.css`\n\n```css\n.Button {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n### `Button.js`\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\nimport \'./Button.css\'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  render() {\n    // You can use them as regular CSS styles\n    return <div className="Button" />;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.\n\nIn development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.\n\nIf you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.\n\n## Post-Processing CSS\n\nThis project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don\u2019t need to worry about it.\n\nFor example, this:\n\n```css\n.App {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\nbecomes this:\n\n```css\n.App {\n  display: -webkit-box;\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\n  display: flex;\n  -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;\n  -webkit-box-direction: normal;\n      -ms-flex-direction: row;\n          flex-direction: row;\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\n      -ms-flex-align: center;\n          align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\nIf you need to disable autoprefixing for some reason, [follow this section](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#disabling).\n\n## Adding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.)\n\nGenerally, we recommend that you don\u2019t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).\n\nFollowing this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s install the command-line interface for Sass:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save node-sass-chokidar\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add node-sass-chokidar\n```\n\nThen in `package.json`, add the following lines to `scripts`:\n\n```diff\n   "scripts": {\n+    "build-css": "node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/",\n+    "watch-css": "npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive",\n     "start": "react-scripts start",\n     "build": "react-scripts build",\n     "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",\n```\n\n>Note: To use a different preprocessor, replace `build-css` and `watch-css` commands according to your preprocessor\u2019s documentation.\n\nNow you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and run `npm run watch-css`. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting `src/App.css`. Since `src/App.js` still imports `src/App.css`, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit `src/App.scss`, and `src/App.css` will be regenerated.\n\nTo share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import "./shared.scss";` with variable definitions.\n\nTo enable importing files without using relative paths, you can add the  `--include-path` option to the command in `package.json`.\n\n```\n"build-css": "node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/",\n"watch-css": "npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive",\n```\n\nThis will allow you to do imports like\n\n```scss\n@import \'styles/_colors.scss\'; // assuming a styles directory under src/\n@import \'nprogress/nprogress\'; // importing a css file from the nprogress node module\n```\n\nAt this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add `src/**/*.css` to your `.gitignore` file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.\n\nAs a final step, you may find it convenient to run `watch-css` automatically with `npm start`, and run `build-css` as a part of `npm run build`. You can use the `&&` operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save npm-run-all\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add npm-run-all\n```\n\nThen we can change `start` and `build` scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:\n\n```diff\n   "scripts": {\n     "build-css": "node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/",\n     "watch-css": "npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive",\n-    "start": "react-scripts start",\n-    "build": "react-scripts build",\n+    "start-js": "react-scripts start",\n+    "start": "npm-run-all -p watch-css start-js",\n+    "build-js": "react-scripts build",\n+    "build": "npm-run-all build-css build-js",\n     "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",\n     "eject": "react-scripts eject"\n   }\n```\n\nNow running `npm start` and `npm run build` also builds Sass files.\n\n**Why `node-sass-chokidar`?**\n\n`node-sass` has been reported as having the following issues:\n\n- `node-sass --watch` has been reported to have *performance issues* in certain conditions when used in a virtual machine or with docker.\n\n- Infinite styles compiling [#1939](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1939)\n\n- `node-sass` has been reported as having issues with detecting new files in a directory [#1891](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1891)\n\n `node-sass-chokidar` is used here as it addresses these issues.\n\n## Adding Images, Fonts, and Files\n\nWith Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.\n\nYou can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.\n\nTo reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1153).\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```js\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport logo from \'./logo.png\'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image\n\nconsole.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png\n\nfunction Header() {\n  // Import result is the URL of your image\n  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;\n}\n\nexport default Header;\n```\n\nThis ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.\n\nThis works in CSS too:\n\n```css\n.Logo {\n  background-image: url(./logo.png);\n}\n```\n\nWebpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don\u2019t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.\n\nPlease be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.\n\n**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>\nAn alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.\n\n## Using the `public` Folder\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\n\n### Changing the HTML\n\nThe `public` folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to [set the page title](#changing-the-page-title).\nThe `<script>` tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.\n\n### Adding Assets Outside of the Module System\n\nYou can also add other assets to the `public` folder.\n\nNote that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.\nFor example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) and [adding images and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files).\nThis mechanism provides a number of benefits:\n\n* Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.\n* Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.\n* Result filenames include content hashes so you don\u2019t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.\n\nHowever there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.\n\nIf you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.   To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.\n\nInside `index.html`, you can use it like this:\n\n```html\n<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">\n```\n\nOnly files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you\u2019ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.\n\nWhen you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.\n\nIn JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!\n  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs\n  // as described in \u201cAdding Images and Fonts\u201d above this section.\n  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \'/img/logo.png\'} />;\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind the downsides of this approach:\n\n* None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.\n* Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.\n* Result filenames won\u2019t include content hashes so you\u2019ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.\n\n### When to Use the `public` Folder\n\nNormally we recommend importing [stylesheets](#adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files) from JavaScript.\nThe `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:\n\n* You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).\n* You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.\n* You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.\n* Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.\n\nNote that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.\n\n## Using Global Variables\n\nWhen you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.\n\nYou can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the `window` object, for example:\n\n```js\nconst $ = window.$;\n```\n\nThis makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.\n\nAlternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding `// eslint-disable-line` after it.\n\n## Adding Bootstrap\n\nYou don\u2019t have to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:\n\nInstall React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from npm. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\n```\n\nImport Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your ```src/index.js``` file:\n\n```js\nimport \'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\';\nimport \'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css\';\n// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your\n// components takes precedence over default styles.\n```\n\nImport required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:\n\n```js\nimport { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from \'react-bootstrap\';\n```\n\nNow you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example [`App.js`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js) redone using React Bootstrap.\n\n### Using a Custom Theme\n\nSometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).<br>\nWe suggest the following approach:\n\n* Create a new package that depends on the package you wish to customize, e.g. Bootstrap.\n* Add the necessary build steps to tweak the theme, and publish your package on npm.\n* Install your own theme npm package as a dependency of your app.\n\nHere is an example of adding a [customized Bootstrap](https://medium.com/@tacomanator/customizing-create-react-app-aa9ffb88165) that follows these steps.\n\n## Adding Flow\n\nFlow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.\n\nRecent versions of [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) work with Create React App projects out of the box.\n\nTo add Flow to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\n\n1. Run `npm install --save flow-bin` (or `yarn add flow-bin`).\n2. Add `"flow": "flow"` to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.\n3. Run `npm run flow init` (or `yarn flow init`) to create a [`.flowconfig` file](https://flowtype.org/docs/advanced-configuration.html) in the root directory.\n4. Add `// @flow` to any files you want to type check (for example, to `src/App.js`).\n\nNow you can run `npm run flow` (or `yarn flow`) to check the files for type errors.\nYou can optionally use an IDE like [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/flow/) for a better integrated experience.\nIn the future we plan to integrate it into Create React App even more closely.\n\nTo learn more about Flow, check out [its documentation](https://flowtype.org/).\n\n## Adding a Router\n\nCreate React App doesn\'t prescribe a specific routing solution, but [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is the most popular one.\n\nTo add it, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-router-dom\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-router-dom\n```\n\nTo try it, delete all the code in `src/App.js` and replace it with any of the examples on its website. The [Basic Example](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic) is a good place to get started.\n\nNote that [you may need to configure your production server to support client-side routing](#serving-apps-with-client-side-routing) before deploying your app.\n\n## Adding Custom Environment Variables\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.\n\nYour project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By\ndefault you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with\n`REACT_APP_`.\n\n**The environment variables are embedded during the build time**. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can\u2019t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like [described here](#injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page). Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.\n\n>Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally [exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\n\nThese environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment\nvariable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`.\n\nThere is also a special built-in environment variable called `NODE_ENV`. You can read it from `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When you run `npm start`, it is always equal to `\'development\'`, when you run `npm test` it is always equal to `\'test\'`, and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to `\'production\'`. **You cannot override `NODE_ENV` manually.** This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.\n\nThese environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is\ndeployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.\n\nFirst, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let\u2019s say you wanted to consume a secret defined\nin the environment inside a `<form>`:\n\n```jsx\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>\n      <form>\n        <input type="hidden" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nDuring the build, `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be replaced with the current value of the `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` environment variable. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically.\n\nWhen you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>\n  <form>\n    <input type="hidden" value="abcdef" />\n  </form>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this\nvalue, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in\na `.env` file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.\n\nHaving access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:\n\n```js\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \'production\') {\n  analytics.disable();\n}\n```\n\nWhen you compile the app with `npm run build`, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.\n\n### Referencing Environment Variables in the HTML\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\n\nYou can also access the environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_` in the `public/index.html`. For example:\n\n```html\n<title>%REACT_APP_WEBSITE_NAME%</title>\n```\n\nNote that the caveats from the above section apply:\n\n* Apart from a few built-in variables (`NODE_ENV` and `PUBLIC_URL`), variable names must start with `REACT_APP_` to work.\n* The environment variables are injected at build time. If you need to inject them at runtime, [follow this approach instead](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server).\n\n### Adding Temporary Environment Variables In Your Shell\n\nDefining environment variables can vary between OSes. It\u2019s also important to know that this manner is temporary for the\nlife of the shell session.\n\n#### Windows (cmd.exe)\n\n```cmd\nset "REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef" && npm start\n```\n\n(Note: Quotes around the variable assignment are required to avoid a trailing whitespace.)\n\n#### Windows (Powershell)\n\n```Powershell\n($env:REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE = "abcdef") -and (npm start)\n```\n\n#### Linux, macOS (Bash)\n\n```bash\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start\n```\n\n### Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\n\nTo define permanent environment variables, create a file called `.env` in the root of your project:\n\n```\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef\n```\n>Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid [accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\n\n`.env` files **should be** checked into source control (with the exclusion of `.env*.local`).\n\n#### What other `.env` files can be used?\n\n>Note: this feature is **available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher**.\n\n* `.env`: Default.\n* `.env.local`: Local overrides. **This file is loaded for all environments except test.**\n* `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.\n* `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.\n\nFiles on the left have more priority than files on the right:\n\n* `npm start`: `.env.development.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`\n* `npm run build`: `.env.production.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.local`, `.env`\n* `npm test`: `.env.test.local`, `.env.test`, `.env` (note `.env.local` is missing)\n\nThese variables will act as the defaults if the machine does not explicitly set them.<br>\nPlease refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.\n\n>Note: If you are defining environment variables for development, your CI and/or hosting platform will most likely need\nthese defined as well. Consult their documentation how to do this. For example, see the documentation for [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).\n\n#### Expanding Environment Variables In `.env`\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@1.1.0` and higher.\n\nExpand variables already on your machine for use in your `.env` file (using [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand)).\n\nFor example, to get the environment variable `npm_package_version`:\n\n```\nREACT_APP_VERSION=$npm_package_version\n# also works:\n# REACT_APP_VERSION=${npm_package_version}\n```\n\nOr expand variables local to the current `.env` file:\n\n```\nDOMAIN=www.example.com\nREACT_APP_FOO=$DOMAIN/foo\nREACT_APP_BAR=$DOMAIN/bar\n```\n\n## Can I Use Decorators?\n\nMany popular libraries use [decorators](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841) in their documentation.<br>\nCreate React App doesn\u2019t support decorator syntax at the moment because:\n\n* It is an experimental proposal and is subject to change.\n* The current specification version is not officially supported by Babel.\n* If the specification changes, we won\u2019t be able to write a codemod because we don\u2019t use them internally at Facebook.\n\nHowever in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without decorators just as fine.<br>\nPlease refer to these two threads for reference:\n\n* [#214](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/214)\n* [#411](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/411)\n\nCreate React App will add decorator support when the specification advances to a stable stage.\n\n## Fetching Data with AJAX Requests\n\nReact doesn\'t prescribe a specific approach to data fetching, but people commonly use either a library like [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) or the [`fetch()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) provided by the browser. Conveniently, Create React App includes a polyfill for `fetch()` so you can use it without worrying about the browser support.\n\nThe global `fetch` function allows to easily makes AJAX requests. It takes in a URL as an input and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `Response` object. You can find more information about `fetch` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).\n\nThis project also includes a [Promise polyfill](https://github.com/then/promise) which provides a full implementation of Promises/A+. A Promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation, you can find more information about Promises [here](https://www.promisejs.org/) and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Both axios and `fetch()` use Promises under the hood. You can also use the [`async / await`](https://davidwalsh.name/async-await) syntax to reduce the callback nesting.\n\nYou can learn more about making AJAX requests from React components in [the FAQ entry on the React website](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html).\n\n## Integrating with an API Backend\n\nThese tutorials will help you to integrate your app with an API backend running on another port,\nusing `fetch()` to access it.\n\n### Node\nCheck out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/).\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo).\n\n### Ruby on Rails\n\nCheck out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/).\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo-rails).\n\n## Proxying API Requests in Development\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.\n\nPeople often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.<br>\nFor example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:\n\n```\n/             - static server returns index.html with React app\n/todos        - static server returns index.html with React app\n/api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation\n```\n\nSuch setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch(\'/api/todos\')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.\n\nTo tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:\n\n```js\n  "proxy": "http://localhost:4000",\n```\n\nThis way, when you `fetch(\'/api/todos\')` in development, the development server will recognize that it\u2019s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will **only** attempt to send requests without `text/html` in its `Accept` header to the proxy.\n\nConveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:\n\n```\nFetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No \'Access-Control-Allow-Origin\' header is present on the requested resource. Origin \'http://localhost:3000\' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request\'s mode to \'no-cors\' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\n```\n\nKeep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don\u2019t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request without a `text/html` accept header will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.\n\nThe `proxy` option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections.<br>\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:\n\n* [Configure the proxy yourself](#configuring-the-proxy-manually)\n* Enable CORS on your server ([here\u2019s how to do it for Express](http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)).\n* Use [environment variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) to inject the right server host and port into your app.\n\n### "Invalid Host Header" Errors After Configuring Proxy\n\nWhen you enable the `proxy` option, you opt into a more strict set of host checks. This is necessary because leaving the backend open to remote hosts makes your computer vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. The issue is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a) and [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887).\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t affect you when developing on `localhost`, but if you develop remotely like [described here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2271), you will see this error in the browser after enabling the `proxy` option:\n\n>Invalid Host header\n\nTo work around it, you can specify your public development host in a file called `.env.development` in the root of your project:\n\n```\nHOST=mypublicdevhost.com\n```\n\nIf you restart the development server now and load the app from the specified host, it should work.\n\nIf you are still having issues or if you\u2019re using a more exotic environment like a cloud editor, you can bypass the host check completely by adding a line to `.env.development.local`. **Note that this is dangerous and exposes your machine to remote code execution from malicious websites:**\n\n```\n# NOTE: THIS IS DANGEROUS!\n# It exposes your machine to attacks from the websites you visit.\nDANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true\n```\n\nWe don\u2019t recommend this approach.\n\n### Configuring the Proxy Manually\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher.\n\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, you can specify an object in the following form (in `package.json`).<br>\nYou may also specify any configuration value [`http-proxy-middleware`](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#options) or [`http-proxy`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#options) supports.\n```js\n{\n  // ...\n  "proxy": {\n    "/api": {\n      "target": "<url>",\n      "ws": true\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nAll requests matching this path will be proxies, no exceptions. This includes requests for `text/html`, which the standard `proxy` option does not proxy.\n\nIf you need to specify multiple proxies, you may do so by specifying additional entries.\nMatches are regular expressions, so that you can use a regexp to match multiple paths.\n```js\n{\n  // ...\n  "proxy": {\n    // Matches any request starting with /api\n    "/api": {\n      "target": "<url_1>",\n      "ws": true\n      // ...\n    },\n    // Matches any request starting with /foo\n    "/foo": {\n      "target": "<url_2>",\n      "ssl": true,\n      "pathRewrite": {\n        "^/foo": "/foo/beta"\n      }\n      // ...\n    },\n    // Matches /bar/abc.html but not /bar/sub/def.html\n    "/bar/[^/]*[.]html": {\n      "target": "<url_3>",\n      // ...\n    },\n    // Matches /baz/abc.html and /baz/sub/def.html\n    "/baz/.*/.*[.]html": {\n      "target": "<url_4>"\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Configuring a WebSocket Proxy\n\nWhen setting up a WebSocket proxy, there are a some extra considerations to be aware of.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a WebSocket engine like [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), you must have a Socket.io server running that you can use as the proxy target. Socket.io will not work with a standard WebSocket server. Specifically, don\'t expect Socket.io to work with [the websocket.org echo test](http://websocket.org/echo.html).\n\nThere\u2019s some good documentation available for [setting up a Socket.io server](https://socket.io/docs/).\n\nStandard WebSockets **will** work with a standard WebSocket server as well as the websocket.org echo test. You can use libraries like [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for the server, with [native WebSockets in the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).\n\nEither way, you can proxy WebSocket requests manually in `package.json`:\n\n```js\n{\n  // ...\n  "proxy": {\n    "/socket": {\n      // Your compatible WebSocket server\n      "target": "ws://<socket_url>",\n      // Tell http-proxy-middleware that this is a WebSocket proxy.\n      // Also allows you to proxy WebSocket requests without an additional HTTP request\n      // https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#external-websocket-upgrade\n      "ws": true\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Using HTTPS in Development\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.\n\nYou may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the "proxy" feature](#proxying-api-requests-in-development) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.\n\nTo do this, set the `HTTPS` environment variable to `true`, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:\n\n#### Windows (cmd.exe)\n\n```cmd\nset HTTPS=true&&npm start\n```\n\n#### Windows (Powershell)\n\n```Powershell\n($env:HTTPS = $true) -and (npm start)\n```\n\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\n\n#### Linux, macOS (Bash)\n\n```bash\nHTTPS=true npm start\n```\n\nNote that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.\n\n## Generating Dynamic `<meta>` Tags on the Server\n\nSince Create React App doesn\u2019t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make `<meta>` tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n  <head>\n    <meta property="og:title" content="__OG_TITLE__">\n    <meta property="og:description" content="__OG_DESCRIPTION__">\n```\n\nThen, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read `index.html` into memory and replace `__OG_TITLE__`, `__OG_DESCRIPTION__`, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!\n\nIf you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases.\n\n## Pre-Rendering into Static HTML Files\n\nIf you\u2019re hosting your `build` with a static hosting provider you can use [react-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot) or [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or \u201chydrated\u201d, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.\n\nThere are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.\n\nThe primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page _with_ the HTML payload\u2014regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.\n\nYou can read more about [zero-configuration pre-rendering (also called snapshotting) here](https://medium.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack-6df0a2791319).\n\n## Injecting Data from the Server into the Page\n\nSimilarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:\n\n```js\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang="en">\n  <head>\n    <script>\n      window.SERVER_DATA = __SERVER_DATA__;\n    <\/script>\n```\n\nThen, on the server, you can replace `__SERVER_DATA__` with a JSON of real data right before sending the response. The client code can then read `window.SERVER_DATA` to use it. **Make sure to [sanitize the JSON before sending it to the client](https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0) as it makes your app vulnerable to XSS attacks.**\n\n## Running Tests\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.<br>\n>[Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)\n\nCreate React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.\n\nJest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.\n\nWhile Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.\n\nWe recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.\n\n### Filename Conventions\n\nJest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:\n\n* Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.\n* Files with `.test.js` suffix.\n* Files with `.spec.js` suffix.\n\nThe `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.\n\nWe recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from \'./App\'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nWhen you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.\n\nThe watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the \u201cWatch Usage\u201d note that the watcher prints after every run:\n\n![Jest watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/img/blog/15-watch.gif)\n\n### Version Control Integration\n\nBy default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don\u2019t often commit the code that doesn\u2019t pass the tests.\n\nJest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.\n\nJest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.\n\n### Writing Tests\n\nTo create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.\n\nJest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:\n\n```js\nimport sum from \'./sum\';\n\nit(\'sums numbers\', () => {\n  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);\n  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);\n});\n```\n\nAll `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html#content).<br>\nYou can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html#tohavebeencalled) to create \u201cspies\u201d or mock functions.\n\n### Testing Components\n\nThere is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a \u201csmoke test\u201d verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.\n\nDifferent projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven\u2019t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:\n\n```js\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport ReactDOM from \'react-dom\';\nimport App from \'./App\';\n\nit(\'renders without crashing\', () => {\n  const div = document.createElement(\'div\');\n  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);\n});\n```\n\nThis test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn\u2019t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot of value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.\n\nWhen you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using [`shallow()` rendering API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) from [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). To install it, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer\n```\n\nAs of Enzyme 3, you will need to install Enzyme along with an Adapter corresponding to the version of React you are using. (The examples above use the adapter for React 16.)\n\nThe adapter will also need to be configured in your [global setup file](#initializing-test-environment):\n\n#### `src/setupTests.js`\n```js\nimport { configure } from \'enzyme\';\nimport Adapter from \'enzyme-adapter-react-16\';\n\nconfigure({ adapter: new Adapter() });\n```\n\n>Note: Keep in mind that if you decide to "eject" before creating `src/setupTests.js`, the resulting `package.json` file won\'t contain any reference to it. [Read here](#initializing-test-environment) to learn how to add this after ejecting.\n\nNow you can write a smoke test with it:\n\n```js\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport { shallow } from \'enzyme\';\nimport App from \'./App\';\n\nit(\'renders without crashing\', () => {\n  shallow(<App />);\n});\n```\n\nUnlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn\u2019t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.\n\nYou can read the [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don\u2019t have to use them because Jest provides built-in `expect()` and `jest.fn()` for spies.\n\nHere is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:\n\n```js\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport { shallow } from \'enzyme\';\nimport App from \'./App\';\n\nit(\'renders welcome message\', () => {\n  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);\n  const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;\n  // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).to.equal(true);\n  expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);\n});\n```\n\nAll Jest matchers are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html).<br>\nNevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) if you want to, as described below.\n\nAdditionally, you might find [jest-enzyme](https://github.com/blainekasten/enzyme-matchers) helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above `contains` code can be written more simply with jest-enzyme.\n\n```js\nexpect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome)\n```\n\nTo enable this, install `jest-enzyme`:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save jest-enzyme\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add jest-enzyme\n```\n\nImport it in [`src/setupTests.js`](#initializing-test-environment) to make its matchers available in every test:\n\n```js\nimport \'jest-enzyme\';\n```\n\n### Using Third Party Assertion Libraries\n\nWe recommend that you use `expect()` for assertions and `jest.fn()` for spies. If you are having issues with them please [file those against Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/new), and we\u2019ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, [pretty-printing React elements as JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1566).\n\nHowever, if you are used to other libraries, such as [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), or if you have existing code using them that you\u2019d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:\n\n```js\nimport sinon from \'sinon\';\nimport { expect } from \'chai\';\n```\n\nand then use them in your tests like you normally do.\n\n### Initializing Test Environment\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.\n\nIf your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you just need a global setup before running your tests, add a `src/setupTests.js` to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.\n\nFor example:\n\n#### `src/setupTests.js`\n```js\nconst localStorageMock = {\n  getItem: jest.fn(),\n  setItem: jest.fn(),\n  clear: jest.fn()\n};\nglobal.localStorage = localStorageMock\n```\n\n>Note: Keep in mind that if you decide to "eject" before creating `src/setupTests.js`, the resulting `package.json` file won\'t contain any reference to it, so you should manually create the property `setupTestFrameworkScriptFile` in the configuration for Jest, something like the following:\n\n>```js\n>"jest": {\n>   // ...\n>   "setupTestFrameworkScriptFile": "<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js"\n>  }\n>  ```\n\n### Focusing and Excluding Tests\n\nYou can replace `it()` with `xit()` to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.<br>\nSimilarly, `fit()` lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.\n\n### Coverage Reporting\n\nJest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.<br>\nRun `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:\n\n![coverage report](http://i.imgur.com/5bFhnTS.png)\n\nNote that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nThe default Jest coverage configuration can be overriden by adding any of the following supported keys to a Jest config in your package.json.\n\nSupported overrides:\n - [`collectCoverageFrom`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoveragefrom-array)\n - [`coverageReporters`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragereporters-array-string)\n - [`coverageThreshold`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragethreshold-object)\n - [`snapshotSerializers`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#snapshotserializers-array-string)\n\nExample package.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  "name": "your-package",\n  "jest": {\n    "collectCoverageFrom" : [\n      "src/**/*.{js,jsx}",\n      "!<rootDir>/node_modules/",\n      "!<rootDir>/path/to/dir/"\n    ],\n    "coverageThreshold": {\n      "global": {\n        "branches": 90,\n        "functions": 90,\n        "lines": 90,\n        "statements": 90\n      }\n    },\n    "coverageReporters": ["text"],\n    "snapshotSerializers": ["my-serializer-module"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nBy default `npm test` runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called `CI`.\n\nWhen creating a build of your application with `npm run build` linter warnings are not checked by default. Like `npm test`, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable `CI`. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.\n\nPopular CI servers already set the environment variable `CI` by default but you can do this yourself too:\n\n### On CI servers\n#### Travis CI\n\n1. Following the [Travis Getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis.  You may need to initialize some settings manually in your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page.\n1. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your git repository.\n```\nlanguage: node_js\nnode_js:\n  - 6\ncache:\n  directories:\n    - node_modules\nscript:\n  - npm run build\n  - npm test\n```\n1. Trigger your first build with a git push.\n1. [Customize your Travis CI Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) if needed.\n\n#### CircleCI\n\nFollow [this article](https://medium.com/@knowbody/circleci-and-zeits-now-sh-c9b7eebcd3c1) to set up CircleCI with a Create React App project.\n\n### On your own environment\n##### Windows (cmd.exe)\n\n```cmd\nset CI=true&&npm test\n```\n\n```cmd\nset CI=true&&npm run build\n```\n\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\n\n##### Windows (Powershell)\n\n```Powershell\n($env:CI = $true) -and (npm test)\n```\n\n```Powershell\n($env:CI = $true) -and (npm run build)\n```\n\n##### Linux, macOS (Bash)\n\n```bash\nCI=true npm test\n```\n\n```bash\nCI=true npm run build\n```\n\nThe test command will force Jest to run tests once instead of launching the watcher.\n\n>  If you find yourself doing this often in development, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/new) to tell us about your use case because we want to make watcher the best experience and are open to changing how it works to accommodate more workflows.\n\nThe build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.\n\n### Disabling jsdom\n\nBy default, the `package.json` of the generated project looks like this:\n\n```js\n  "scripts": {\n    "start": "react-scripts start",\n    "build": "react-scripts build",\n    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"\n```\n\nIf you know that none of your tests depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), you can safely remove `--env=jsdom`, and your tests will run faster:\n\n```diff\n  "scripts": {\n    "start": "react-scripts start",\n    "build": "react-scripts build",\n-   "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"\n+   "test": "react-scripts test"\n```\n\nTo help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that **need jsdom**:\n\n* Any browser globals like `window` and `document`\n* [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render)\n* [`TestUtils.renderIntoDocument()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#renderintodocument) ([a shortcut](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/34761cf9a252964abfaab6faf74d473ad95d1f21/src/test/ReactTestUtils.js#L83-L91) for the above)\n* [`mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\n\nIn contrast, **jsdom is not needed** for the following APIs:\n\n* [`TestUtils.createRenderer()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) (shallow rendering)\n* [`shallow()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\n\nFinally, jsdom is also not needed for [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).\n\n### Snapshot Testing\n\nSnapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. [Read more about snapshot testing.](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)\n\n### Editor Integration\n\nIf you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), there is a [Jest extension](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest) which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.\n\n![VS Code Jest Preview](/github-readme-images/react-quiz/a032308a-b7c8-11e6-9b34-7eeac781003f.png)\n\n## Debugging Tests\n\nThere are various ways to setup a debugger for your Jest tests. We cover debugging in Chrome and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n>Note: debugging tests requires Node 8 or higher.\n\n### Debugging Tests in Chrome\n\nAdd the following to the `scripts` section in your project\'s `package.json`\n```json\n"scripts": {\n    "test:debug": "react-scripts --inspect-brk test --runInBand --env=jsdom"\n  }\n```\nPlace `debugger;` statements in any test and run:\n```bash\n$ npm run test:debug\n```\n\nThis will start running your Jest tests, but pause before executing to allow a debugger to attach to the process.\n\nOpen the following in Chrome\n```\nabout:inspect\n```\n\nAfter opening that link, the Chrome Developer Tools will be displayed. Select `inspect` on your process and a breakpoint will be set at the first line of the react script (this is done simply to give you time to open the developer tools and to prevent Jest from executing before you have time to do so). Click the button that looks like a "play" button in the upper right hand side of the screen to continue execution. When Jest executes the test that contains the debugger statement, execution will pause and you can examine the current scope and call stack.\n\n>Note: the --runInBand cli option makes sure Jest runs test in the same process rather than spawning processes for individual tests. Normally Jest parallelizes test runs across processes but it is hard to debug many processes at the same time.\n\n### Debugging Tests in Visual Studio Code\n\nDebugging Jest tests is supported out of the box for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).\n\nUse the following [`launch.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) configuration file:\n```\n{\n  "version": "0.2.0",\n  "configurations": [\n    {\n      "name": "Debug CRA Tests",\n      "type": "node",\n      "request": "launch",\n      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",      \n      "args": [\n        "test",\n        "--runInBand",\n        "--no-cache",\n        "--env=jsdom"\n      ],\n      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",\n      "protocol": "inspector",\n      "console": "integratedTerminal",\n      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Developing Components in Isolation\n\nUsually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states.\nFor an example, a simple button component could have following states:\n\n* In a regular state, with a text label.\n* In the disabled mode.\n* In a loading state.\n\nUsually, it\u2019s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.\n\nCreate React App doesn\u2019t include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add [Storybook for React](https://storybook.js.org) ([source](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)) or [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)) to your project. **These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.\n\n![Storybook for React Demo](http://i.imgur.com/7CIAWpB.gif)\n\nYou can also deploy your Storybook or style guide as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.\n\n### Getting Started with Storybook\n\nStorybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\n\nFirst, install the following npm package globally:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g @storybook/cli\n```\n\nThen, run the following command inside your app\u2019s directory:\n\n```sh\ngetstorybook\n```\n\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nLearn more about React Storybook:\n\n* Screencast: [Getting Started with React Storybook](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-getting-started-with-react-storybook)\n* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)\n* [Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/basics/introduction/)\n* [Snapshot Testing UI](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots) with Storybook + addon/storyshot\n\n### Getting Started with Styleguidist\n\nStyleguidist combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.\n\nFirst, install Styleguidist:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-styleguidist\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-styleguidist\n```\n\nThen, add these scripts to your `package.json`:\n\n```diff\n   "scripts": {\n+    "styleguide": "styleguidist server",\n+    "styleguide:build": "styleguidist build",\n     "start": "react-scripts start",\n```\n\nThen, run the following command inside your app\u2019s directory:\n\n```sh\nnpm run styleguide\n```\n\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nLearn more about React Styleguidist:\n\n* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)\n* [Documentation](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/getting-started.html)\n\n## Publishing Components to npm\n\nCreate React App doesn\'t provide any built-in functionality to publish a component to npm. If you\'re ready to extract a component from your project so other people can use it, we recommend moving it to a separate directory outside of your project and then using a tool like [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries) to prepare it for publishing.\n\n## Making a Progressive Web App\n\nBy default, the production build is a fully functional, offline-first\n[Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).\n\nProgressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:\n\n * All static site assets are cached so that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.\n * Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the subway.\n * On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user\'s home screen, app icon and all. You can also re-engage users using web **push notifications**. This eliminates the need for the app store.\n\nThe [`sw-precache-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin)\nis integrated into production configuration,\nand it will take care of generating a service worker file that will automatically\nprecache all of your local assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates.\nThe service worker will use a [cache-first strategy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)\nfor handling all requests for local assets, including the initial HTML, ensuring\nthat your web app is reliably fast, even on a slow or unreliable network.\n\n### Opting Out of Caching\n\nIf you would prefer not to enable service workers prior to your initial\nproduction deployment, then remove the call to `registerServiceWorker()`\nfrom [`src/index.js`](src/index.js).\n\nIf you had previously enabled service workers in your production deployment and\nhave decided that you would like to disable them for all your existing users,\nyou can swap out the call to `registerServiceWorker()` in\n[`src/index.js`](src/index.js) first by modifying the service worker import:\n```javascript\nimport { unregister } from \'./registerServiceWorker\';\n```\nand then call `unregister()` instead.\nAfter the user visits a page that has `unregister()`,\nthe service worker will be uninstalled. Note that depending on how `/service-worker.js` is served,\nit may take up to 24 hours for the cache to be invalidated.\n\n### Offline-First Considerations\n\n1. Service workers [require HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https),\nalthough to facilitate local testing, that policy\n[does not apply to `localhost`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385).\nIf your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker\nregistration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.\n\n1. Service workers are [not currently supported](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/)\nin all web browsers. Service worker registration [won\'t be attempted](src/registerServiceWorker.js)\non browsers that lack support.\n\n1. The service worker is only enabled in the [production environment](#deployment),\ne.g. the output of `npm run build`. It\'s recommended that you do not enable an\noffline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to\nfrustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest\nchanges you\'ve made locally.\n\n1. If you *need* to test your offline-first service worker locally, build\nthe application (using `npm run build`) and run a simple http server from your\nbuild directory. After running the build script, `create-react-app` will give\ninstructions for one way to test your production build locally and the [deployment instructions](#deployment) have\ninstructions for using other methods. *Be sure to always use an\nincognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache.*\n\n1. If possible, configure your production environment to serve the generated\n`service-worker.js` [with HTTP caching disabled](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38843970/service-worker-javascript-update-frequency-every-24-hours).\nIf that\'s not possible\u2014[GitHub Pages](#github-pages), for instance, does not\nallow you to change the default 10 minute HTTP cache lifetime\u2014then be aware\nthat if you visit your production site, and then revisit again before\n`service-worker.js` has expired from your HTTP cache, you\'ll continue to get\nthe previously cached assets from the service worker. If you have an immediate\nneed to view your updated production deployment, performing a shift-refresh\nwill temporarily disable the service worker and retrieve all assets from the\nnetwork.\n\n1. Users aren\'t always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to\n[let the user know](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption)\nwhen the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a "This web\napp works offline!" message) and also let them know when the service worker has\nfetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the\npage (showing a "New content is available; please refresh." message). Showing\nthis messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a\nstarting point, you can make use of the logic included in [`src/registerServiceWorker.js`](src/registerServiceWorker.js), which\ndemonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each\nscenario, and which as a default, just logs appropriate messages to the\nJavaScript console.\n\n1. By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any\ncross-origin traffic, like HTTP [API requests](#integrating-with-an-api-backend),\nimages, or embeds loaded from a different domain. If you would like to use a\nruntime caching strategy for those requests, you can [`eject`](#npm-run-eject)\nand then configure the\n[`runtimeCaching`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#runtimecaching-arrayobject)\noption in the `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` section of\n[`webpack.config.prod.js`](../config/webpack.config.prod.js).\n\n### Progressive Web App Metadata\n\nThe default configuration includes a web app manifest located at\n[`public/manifest.json`](public/manifest.json), that you can customize with\ndetails specific to your web application.\n\nWhen a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on\nAndroid, the metadata in [`manifest.json`](public/manifest.json) determines what\nicons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.\n[The Web App Manifest guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/)\nprovides more context about what each field means, and how your customizations\nwill affect your users\' experience.\n\n## Analyzing the Bundle Size\n\n[Source map explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) analyzes\nJavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code\nbloat is coming from.\n\nTo add Source map explorer to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save source-map-explorer\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add source-map-explorer\n```\n\nThen in `package.json`, add the following line to `scripts`:\n\n```diff\n   "scripts": {\n+    "analyze": "source-map-explorer build/static/js/main.*",\n     "start": "react-scripts start",\n     "build": "react-scripts build",\n     "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",\n```\n\nThen to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze\nscript.\n\n```\nnpm run build\nnpm run analyze\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\n`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.\n\n### Static Server\n\nFor environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g serve\nserve -s build\n```\n\nThe last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)\u2019s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.\n\nRun this command to get a full list of the options available:\n\n```sh\nserve -h\n```\n\n### Other Solutions\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.\n\nHere\u2019s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/):\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\'express\');\nconst path = require(\'path\');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \'build\')));\n\napp.get(\'/\', function (req, res) {\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \'build\', \'index.html\'));\n});\n\napp.listen(9000);\n```\n\nThe choice of your server software isn\u2019t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there\u2019s no need to explicitly use Node.\n\nThe `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.\n\nHowever this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.\n\n### Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing\n\nIf you use routers that use the HTML5 [`pushState` history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries) under the hood (for example, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) with `browserHistory`), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the development server will respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.\n\nThis is because when there is a fresh page load for a `/todos/42`, the server looks for the file `build/todos/42` and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to `/todos/42` by serving `index.html`. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve `index.html` for any unknown paths:\n\n```diff\n app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \'build\')));\n\n-app.get(\'/\', function (req, res) {\n+app.get(\'/*\', function (req, res) {\n   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \'build\', \'index.html\'));\n });\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), you need to create a `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder that looks like this:\n\n```\n    Options -MultiViews\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]\n```\n\nIt will get copied to the `build` folder when you run `npm run build`. \n\nIf you\u2019re using [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), you need to follow [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41249464/4878474).\n\nNow requests to `/todos/42` will be handled correctly both in development and in production.\n\nOn a production build, and in a browser that supports [service workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers),\nthe service worker will automatically handle all navigation requests, like for\n`/todos/42`, by serving the cached copy of your `index.html`. This\nservice worker navigation routing can be configured or disabled by\n[`eject`ing](#npm-run-eject) and then modifying the\n[`navigateFallback`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallback-string)\nand [`navigateFallbackWhitelist`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallbackwhitelist-arrayregexp)\noptions of the `SWPreachePlugin` [configuration](../config/webpack.config.prod.js).\n\nWhen users install your app to the homescreen of their device the default configuration will make a shortcut to `/index.html`. This may not work for client-side routers which expect the app to be served from `/`. Edit the web app manifest at [`public/manifest.json`](public/manifest.json) and change `start_url` to match the required URL scheme, for example:\n\n```js\n  "start_url": ".",\n```\n\n### Building for Relative Paths\n\nBy default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.<br>\nTo override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:\n\n```js\n  "homepage": "http://mywebsite.com/relativepath",\n```\n\nThis will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.\n\n**Note**: If you are using `react-router@^4`, you can root `<Link>`s using the `basename` prop on any `<Router>`.<br>\nMore information [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter/basename-string).<br>\n<br>\nFor example:\n```js\n<BrowserRouter basename="/calendar"/>\n<Link to="/today"/> // renders <a href="/calendar/today">\n```\n\n#### Serving the Same Build from Different Paths\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\n\nIf you are not using the HTML5 `pushState` history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your `package.json`:\n\n```js\n  "homepage": ".",\n```\n\nThis will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to `index.html`. You will then be able to move your app from `http://mywebsite.com` to `http://mywebsite.com/relativepath` or even `http://mywebsite.com/relative/path` without having to rebuild it.\n\n### [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)\n\nSee [this](https://medium.com/@to_pe/deploying-create-react-app-on-microsoft-azure-c0f6686a4321) blog post on how to deploy your React app to Microsoft Azure.\n\nSee [this](https://medium.com/@strid/host-create-react-app-on-azure-986bc40d5bf2#.pycfnafbg) blog post or [this](https://github.com/ulrikaugustsson/azure-appservice-static) repo for a way to use automatic deployment to Azure App Service.\n\n### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)\n\nInstall the Firebase CLI if you haven\u2019t already by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`. Sign up for a [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Run `firebase login` and login with your previous created Firebase account.\n\nThen run the `firebase init` command from your project\u2019s root. You need to choose the **Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites** and choose the Firebase project you created in the previous step. You will need to agree with `database.rules.json` being created, choose `build` as the public directory, and also agree to **Configure as a single-page app** by replying with `y`.\n\n```sh\n    === Project Setup\n\n    First, let\'s associate this project directory with a Firebase project.\n    You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,\n    but for now we\'ll just set up a default project.\n\n    ? What Firebase project do you want to associate as default? Example app (example-app-fd690)\n\n    === Database Setup\n\n    Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be\n    structured and when your data can be read from and written to.\n\n    ? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json\n    \u2714  Database Rules for example-app-fd690 have been downloaded to database.rules.json.\n    Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run\n    firebase deploy.\n\n    === Hosting Setup\n\n    Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that\n    will contain Hosting assets to uploaded with firebase deploy. If you\n    have a build process for your assets, use your build\'s output directory.\n\n    ? What do you want to use as your public directory? build\n    ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes\n    \u2714  Wrote build/index.html\n\n    i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...\n    i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...\n\n    \u2714  Firebase initialization complete!\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: you need to set proper HTTP caching headers for `service-worker.js` file in `firebase.json` file or you will not be able to see changes after first deployment ([issue #2440](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2440)). It should be added inside `"hosting"` key like next:\n\n```\n{\n  "hosting": {\n    ...\n    "headers": [\n      {"source": "/service-worker.js", "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache"}]}\n    ]\n    ...\n```\n\nNow, after you create a production build with `npm run build`, you can deploy it by running `firebase deploy`.\n\n```sh\n    === Deploying to \'example-app-fd690\'...\n\n    i  deploying database, hosting\n    \u2714  database: rules ready to deploy.\n    i  hosting: preparing build directory for upload...\n    Uploading: [==============================          ] 75%\u2714  hosting: build folder uploaded successfully\n    \u2714  hosting: 8 files uploaded successfully\n    i  starting release process (may take several minutes)...\n\n    \u2714  Deploy complete!\n\n    Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/example-app-fd690/overview\n    Hosting URL: https://example-app-fd690.firebaseapp.com\n```\n\nFor more information see [Add Firebase to your JavaScript Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).\n\n### [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)\n\n>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.\n\n#### Step 1: Add `homepage` to `package.json`\n\n**The step below is important!**<br>\n**If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.**\n\nOpen your `package.json` and add a `homepage` field for your project:\n\n```json\n  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",\n```\n\nor for a GitHub user page:\n\n```json\n  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io",\n```\n\nCreate React App uses the `homepage` field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.\n\n#### Step 2: Install `gh-pages` and add `deploy` to `scripts` in `package.json`\n\nNow, whenever you run `npm run build`, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.\n\nTo publish it at [https://myusername.github.io/my-app](https://myusername.github.io/my-app), run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save gh-pages\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add gh-pages\n```\n\nAdd the following scripts in your `package.json`:\n\n```diff\n  "scripts": {\n+   "predeploy": "npm run build",\n+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",\n    "start": "react-scripts start",\n    "build": "react-scripts build",\n```\n\nThe `predeploy` script will run automatically before `deploy` is run.\n\nIf you are deploying to a GitHub user page instead of a project page you\'ll need to make two\nadditional modifications:\n\n1. First, change your repository\'s source branch to be any branch other than **master**.\n1. Additionally, tweak your `package.json` scripts to push deployments to **master**:\n```diff\n  "scripts": {\n    "predeploy": "npm run build",\n-   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",\n+   "deploy": "gh-pages -b master -d build",\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Deploy the site by running `npm run deploy`\n\nThen run:\n\n```sh\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Ensure your project\u2019s settings use `gh-pages`\n\nFinally, make sure **GitHub Pages** option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch:\n\n<img src="http://i.imgur.com/HUjEr9l.png" width="500" alt="gh-pages branch setting">\n\n#### Step 5: Optionally, configure the domain\n\nYou can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.\n\n#### Notes on client-side routing\n\nGitHub Pages doesn\u2019t support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood (for example, React Router using `browserHistory`). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:\n\n* You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Router) about different history implementations in React Router.\n* Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you\u2019ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).\n\n### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)\n\nUse the [Heroku Buildpack for Create React App](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).<br>\nYou can find instructions in [Deploying React with Zero Configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).\n\n#### Resolving Heroku Deployment Errors\n\nSometimes `npm run build` works locally but fails during deploy via Heroku. Following are the most common cases.\n\n##### "Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \'file\' or \'directory\'"\n\nIf you get something like this:\n\n```\nremote: Failed to create a production build. Reason:\nremote: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \'file\' or \'directory\'\nMyDirectory in /tmp/build_1234/src\n```\n\nIt means you need to ensure that the lettercase of the file or directory you `import` matches the one you see on your filesystem or on GitHub.\n\nThis is important because Linux (the operating system used by Heroku) is case sensitive. So `MyDirectory` and `mydirectory` are two distinct directories and thus, even though the project builds locally, the difference in case breaks the `import` statements on Heroku remotes.\n\n##### "Could not find a required file."\n\nIf you exclude or ignore necessary files from the package you will see a error similar this one:\n\n```\nremote: Could not find a required file.\nremote:   Name: `index.html`\nremote:   Searched in: /tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/public\nremote:\nremote: npm ERR! Linux 3.13.0-105-generic\nremote: npm ERR! argv "/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/node" "/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/npm" "run" "build"\n```\n\nIn this case, ensure that the file is there with the proper lettercase and that\u2019s not ignored on your local `.gitignore` or `~/.gitignore_global`.\n\n### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n\n**To do a manual deploy to Netlify\u2019s CDN:**\n\n```sh\nnpm install netlify-cli -g\nnetlify deploy\n```\n\nChoose `build` as the path to deploy.\n\n**To setup continuous delivery:**\n\nWith this setup Netlify will build and deploy when you push to git or open a pull request:\n\n1. [Start a new netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup)\n2. Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository\n3. Set `yarn build` as the build command and `build` as the publish directory\n4. Click `Deploy site`\n\n**Support for client-side routing:**\n\nTo support `pushState`, make sure to create a `public/_redirects` file with the following rewrite rules:\n\n```\n/*  /index.html  200\n```\n\nWhen you build the project, Create React App will place the `public` folder contents into the build output.\n\n### [Now](https://zeit.co/now)\n\nNow offers a zero-configuration single-command deployment. You can use `now` to deploy your app for free.\n\n1. Install the `now` command-line tool either via the recommended [desktop tool](https://zeit.co/download) or via node with `npm install -g now`.\n\n2. Build your app by running `npm run build`.\n\n3. Move into the build directory by running `cd build`.\n\n4. Run `now --name your-project-name` from within the build directory. You will see a **now.sh** URL in your output like this:\n\n    ```\n    > Ready! https://your-project-name-tpspyhtdtk.now.sh (copied to clipboard)\n    ```\n\n    Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app.\n\nDetails are available in [this article.](https://zeit.co/blog/unlimited-static)\n\n### [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)\n\nSee this [blog post](https://medium.com/@omgwtfmarc/deploying-create-react-app-to-s3-or-cloudfront-48dae4ce0af) on how to deploy your React app to Amazon Web Services S3 and CloudFront.\n\n### [Surge](https://surge.sh/)\n\nInstall the Surge CLI if you haven\u2019t already by running `npm install -g surge`. Run the `surge` command and log in you or create a new account.\n\nWhen asked about the project path, make sure to specify the `build` folder, for example:\n\n```sh\n       project path: /path/to/project/build\n```\n\nNote that in order to support routers that use HTML5 `pushState` API, you may want to rename the `index.html` in your build folder to `200.html` before deploying to Surge. This [ensures that every URL falls back to that file](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing).\n\n## Advanced Configuration\n\nYou can adjust various development and production settings by setting environment variables in your shell or with [.env](#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env).\n\nVariable | Development | Production | Usage\n:--- | :---: | :---: | :---\nBROWSER | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, Create React App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS. Specify a [browser](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn#app) to override this behavior, or set it to `none` to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to `npm start` will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your script\'s file name must have the `.js` extension.\nHOST | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, the development web server binds to `localhost`. You may use this variable to specify a different host.\nPORT | :white_check_mark: | :x: | By default, the development web server will attempt to listen on port 3000 or prompt you to attempt the next available port. You may use this variable to specify a different port.\nHTTPS | :white_check_mark: | :x: | When set to `true`, Create React App will run the development server in `https` mode.\nPUBLIC_URL | :x: | :white_check_mark: | Create React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web server\'s root or a subpath as specified in [`package.json` (`homepage`)](#building-for-relative-paths). Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname. You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included). This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.\nCI | :large_orange_diamond: | :white_check_mark: | When set to `true`, Create React App treats warnings as failures in the build. It also makes the test runner non-watching. Most CIs set this flag by default.\nREACT_EDITOR | :white_check_mark: | :x: | When an app crashes in development, you will see an error overlay with clickable stack trace. When you click on it, Create React App will try to determine the editor you are using based on currently running processes, and open the relevant source file. You can [send a pull request to detect your editor of choice](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2636). Setting this environment variable overrides the automatic detection. If you do it, make sure your systems [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) environment variable points to your editor\u2019s bin folder. You can also set it to `none` to disable it completely.\nCHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING | :white_check_mark: | :x: | When set to `true`, the watcher runs in polling mode, as necessary inside a VM. Use this option if `npm start` isn\'t detecting changes.\nGENERATE_SOURCEMAP | :x: | :white_check_mark: | When set to `false`, source maps are not generated for a production build. This solves OOM issues on some smaller machines.\nNODE_PATH | :white_check_mark: |  :white_check_mark: | Same as [`NODE_PATH` in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders), but only relative folders are allowed. Can be handy for emulating a monorepo setup by setting `NODE_PATH=src`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### `npm start` doesn\u2019t detect changes\n\nWhen you save a file while `npm start` is running, the browser should refresh with the updated code.<br>\nIf this doesn\u2019t happen, try one of the following workarounds:\n\n* If your project is in a Dropbox folder, try moving it out.\n* If the watcher doesn\u2019t see a file called `index.js` and you\u2019re referencing it by the folder name, you [need to restart the watcher](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1164) due to a Webpack bug.\n* Some editors like Vim and IntelliJ have a \u201csafe write\u201d feature that currently breaks the watcher. You will need to disable it. Follow the instructions in [\u201cAdjusting Your Text Editor\u201d](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor).\n* If your project path contains parentheses, try moving the project to a path without them. This is caused by a [Webpack watcher bug](https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/issues/42).\n* On Linux and macOS, you might need to [tweak system settings](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/troubleshooting#not-enough-watchers) to allow more watchers.\n* If the project runs inside a virtual machine such as (a Vagrant provisioned) VirtualBox, create an `.env` file in your project directory if it doesn\u2019t exist, and add `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` to it. This ensures that the next time you run `npm start`, the watcher uses the polling mode, as necessary inside a VM.\n\nIf none of these solutions help please leave a comment [in this thread](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/659).\n\n### `npm test` hangs on macOS Sierra\n\nIf you run `npm test` and the console gets stuck after printing `react-scripts test --env=jsdom` to the console there might be a problem with your [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) installation as described in [facebookincubator/create-react-app#713](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/713).\n\nWe recommend deleting `node_modules` in your project and running `npm install` (or `yarn` if you use it) first. If it doesn\'t help, you can try one of the numerous workarounds mentioned in these issues:\n\n* [facebook/jest#1767](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767)\n* [facebook/watchman#358](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/358)\n* [ember-cli/ember-cli#6259](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/6259)\n\nIt is reported that installing Watchman 4.7.0 or newer fixes the issue. If you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can run these commands to update it:\n\n```\nwatchman shutdown-server\nbrew update\nbrew reinstall watchman\n```\n\nYou can find [other installation methods](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html#build-install) on the Watchman documentation page.\n\nIf this still doesn\u2019t help, try running `launchctl unload -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist`.\n\nThere are also reports that *uninstalling* Watchman fixes the issue. So if nothing else helps, remove it from your system and try again.\n\n### `npm run build` exits too early\n\nIt is reported that `npm run build` can fail on machines with limited memory and no swap space, which is common in cloud environments. Even with small projects this command can increase RAM usage in your system by hundreds of megabytes, so if you have less than 1 GB of available memory your build is likely to fail with the following message:\n\n>  The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process.\n\nIf you are completely sure that you didn\'t terminate the process, consider [adding some swap space](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04) to the machine you\u2019re building on, or build the project locally.\n\n### `npm run build` fails on Heroku\n\nThis may be a problem with case sensitive filenames.\nPlease refer to [this section](#resolving-heroku-deployment-errors).\n\n### Moment.js locales are missing\n\nIf you use a [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), you might notice that only the English locale is available by default. This is because the locale files are large, and you probably only need a subset of [all the locales provided by Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/#multiple-locale-support).\n\nTo add a specific Moment.js locale to your bundle, you need to import it explicitly.<br>\nFor example:\n\n```js\nimport moment from \'moment\';\nimport \'moment/locale/fr\';\n```\n\nIf import multiple locales this way, you can later switch between them by calling `moment.locale()` with the locale name:\n\n```js\nimport moment from \'moment\';\nimport \'moment/locale/fr\';\nimport \'moment/locale/es\';\n\n// ...\n\nmoment.locale(\'fr\');\n```\n\nThis will only work for locales that have been explicitly imported before.\n\n### `npm run build` fails to minify\n\nSome third-party packages don\'t compile their code to ES5 before publishing to npm. This often causes problems in the ecosystem because neither browsers (except for most modern versions) nor some tools currently support all ES6 features. We recommend to publish code on npm as ES5 at least for a few more years.\n\n<br>\nTo resolve this:\n\n1. Open an issue on the dependency\'s issue tracker and ask that the package be published pre-compiled.\n  * Note: Create React App can consume both CommonJS and ES modules. For Node.js compatibility, it is recommended that the main entry point is CommonJS. However, they can optionally provide an ES module entry point with the `module` field in `package.json`. Note that **even if a library provides an ES Modules version, it should still precompile other ES6 features to ES5 if it intends to support older browsers**.\n\n2. Fork the package and publish a corrected version yourself. \n\n3. If the dependency is small enough, copy it to your `src/` folder and treat it as application code.\n\nIn the future, we might start automatically compiling incompatible third-party modules, but it is not currently supported. This approach would also slow down the production builds.\n\n## Alternatives to Ejecting\n\n[Ejecting](#npm-run-eject) lets you customize anything, but from that point on you have to maintain the configuration and scripts yourself. This can be daunting if you have many similar projects. In such cases instead of ejecting we recommend to *fork* `react-scripts` and any other packages you need. [This article](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-configure-create-react-app/) dives into how to do it in depth. You can find more discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/682).\n\n## Something Missing?\n\nIf you have ideas for more \u201cHow To\u201d recipes that should be on this page, [let us know](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues) or [contribute some!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/edit/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)\n',"react-myreads":'# MyReads Project\n\nThis is the first project as part of the Udacity\'s React Nanodegree.

They are raw results only. \n\n## Important\nThe backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don\'t be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don\'t come back with any results.\n\n## Create React App\n\nThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)\n',"react-would-you-rather":'\n# About the project\nThis is the 2nd project as part of Udacity Nanodegree program. It is an implementation of  "Would you rather?" game popular among school kids.\n\nIn the "Would You Rather?" Project, I\'ve built a web app that lets a user play the \u201cWould You Rather?\u201d game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: \u201cWould you rather [option A] or [option B] ?\u201d. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.\n\nIn this app, users are able to answer questions, see which questions they haven\u2019t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.\n\n# How to setup and run project locally\n- Download/Clone this repo\n- Go to the root folder\n- Run `npm install`\n- Run `npm start`\n- Project should run. Chrome is the preferred browser for testing.\n\n# How to run automated test\n- run `npx cypress open` to open cypress\n- select the test and run it\n\n# Skills Used\nThis project was the perfect for practising all of the following skills in the world of React.\n- React\n- Redux\n- ES6\n- Redux Thunk\n- HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n- React Bootstrap\n- Cypress, Cucumber, BDD\n\n# Screenshots\n\n<img src="/github-readme-images/react-would-you-rather/login.png"/> \n\n<img src="/github-readme-images/react-would-you-rather/home.png"/> \n\n<img src="/github-readme-images/react-would-you-rather/enterpoll.png"/> \n\n<img src="/github-readme-images/react-would-you-rather/pollresult.png"/> \n\n<img src="/github-readme-images/react-would-you-rather/leaderboard.png"/> \n\n\n# Automated Testing using Cypress\nThis project is fully automated tested using Cypress + Cucumber. See below sample test run.\n\n<img src="/github-readme-images/react-would-you-rather/cypresstest.png"/>\n\n\n# App Requirements & Functionality\n```Below are the original requirements given by Udacity upon which the project was built and delievered. ```\n\nThe person using your application should have a way of impersonating/logging in as an existing user. (This could be as simple as having a login box that appears at the root of the application that lets the user select a name from the list of existing users. Alternatively, you could create your own account creation process to allow a user to sign up for an account.) Your application should work correctly regardless of which user is selected. Once the user logs in, the home page should be shown.\n\nWe always want to make sure we know who the logged in user is, so information about the logged in user should appear on the page. If someone tries to navigate anywhere by entering the address in the address bar, the user is asked to sign in and then the requested page is shown. The application allows the user to log out and log back in.\n\nOnce the user logs in, the user should be able to toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page, which is located at the root. The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom). The unanswered questions should be shown by default, and the name of the logged in user should be visible on the page.\n\nWhat would be the point of seeing answered and unanswered polling questions if we couldn\u2019t actually vote or see the results? Each polling question should link to the details of that poll. The details of each poll should be available at `questions/:question_id`.\n\nWhen a poll is clicked on the home page, the following is shown:\n\n- Text \u201cWould You Rather\u201d;\n- Avatar of the user who posted the polling question; and\n- Two options.\n\nFor answered polls, each of the two options contains the following:\n\n- Text of the option;\n- Number of people who voted for that option; and\n- Percentage of people who voted for that option.\n\nThe option selected by the logged-in user should be clearly marked.\n\nSince we want to make sure our application creates a good user experience, the application should show a 404 page if the user is trying to access a poll that does not exist. (Please keep in mind that newly created polls will not be accessible at their url because of the way the backend is set up in this application.) It should also display a navigation bar so that the user can easily navigate anywhere in the application.\n\nSo what happens when someone votes in a poll? Upon voting in a poll, all of the information of an answered poll should be displayed. The user\u2019s response should be recorded and clearly visible on the poll details page. Users can only vote once per poll; they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to change their answer after they\u2019ve voted -- no cheating allowed! When the user comes back to the home page, the polling question should appear in the \u201cAnswered\u201d column.\n\nIt would be no fun to vote in polls if we couldn\u2019t post our own questions! The form for posting new polling questions should be available at the `/add` route. The application should show the text \u201cWould You Rather\u201d and have a form for creating two options. Upon submitting the form, a new poll should be created, the user should be taken to the home page, and the new polling question should appear in the correct category on the home page.\n\nBut how can we know how many questions each user has asked and answered? Let\u2019s get some healthy competition going here! The application should have a leaderboard that\u2019s available at the `/leaderboard` route. Each entry on the leaderboard should contain the following:\n\n\n- User\u2019s name;\n- User\u2019s picture;\n- Number of questions the user asked; and\n- Number of questions the user answered\n\nUsers should be ordered in descending order based on the sum of the number of questions they\u2019ve asked and the number of questions they\u2019ve answered. The more questions you ask and answer, the higher up you move.\n\nThe user should be able to navigate to the leaderboard, to a specific question, and to the form that allows the user to create a new poll both from within the app and by typing in the address into the address bar. To make sure we\u2019re showing the data that is relevant to the user, the application should require the user to be signed in order to access those pages.\n\n\n\n# Notes\n\nThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\n\n## Available Scripts\n\nIn the project directory, you can run:\n\n### `yarn start`\n\nRuns the app in the development mode.<br />\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload if you make edits.<br />\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\n\n### `yarn test`\n\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />\nSee the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.\n\n### `yarn build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\n\nSee the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.\n\n### `yarn eject`\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can\u2019t go back!**\n\nIf you aren\u2019t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\u2019re on your own.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\u2019t be useful if you couldn\u2019t customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Learn More\n\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).\n\nTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nThis section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting\n\n### Analyzing the Bundle Size\n\nThis section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size\n\n### Making a Progressive Web App\n\nThis section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nThis section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration\n\n### Deployment\n\nThis section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment\n\n### `yarn build` fails to minify\n\nThis section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify\n',"rest_api-mongo-v1":"# Project 9 - Treehouse Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree\n# REST API\n## Project Spec\nIn this project, you\u2019ll create a REST API using Express.

It is about building a web application for a company called Car Hub. This company's main business is to buy old car, repair it and then resell. This web application allows the company to manage their car inventory and let their customer's view what cards they have got at moment.\n\n# Project requirement\nThis project is developed for a car dealership called Car Hub. His owner, Eddie needs a new web application to manage his lot inventory. Below is the requirement as described by Eddie.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing everything with spreadsheets for so long because I don\u2019t know anything else. I\u2019ve never even had a website. I\u2019m excited to see your ideas! As promised, here are the details.\n\nI usually buy cars at auction, make repairs, then resell them at a small profit. My business model is based on the idea that I believe can make more money long term by trading in volume, so I just add $500 to my total costs for each car. I add the auction price and the cost of repairs and conditioning, plus $500, to get my selling price.\n\nI want to be able to view all the cars in my inventory, add new cars, make changes to current listings (like adding new photos and other details), and mark cars as sold or no longer available. I don\u2019t want anyone else to have access to this part of things. I want everyone to be able to see what I have available on my lot, but I need to be the only person with access to make changes. If you can show me something like that, I\u2019ll be happy. I\u2019ve heard stories about companies getting hacked through their websites. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019ve stayed away from it for so long. I don\u2019t want my site to be vulnerable.\n\nSince this is a prototype, I don\u2019t care too much about what it looks like yet. I mean, I\u2019d like to see a nice looking home page, just to give me an idea of what you can do for me. But for the rest of it, I just want to be able to see how I\u2019d add cars, make changes, that sort of thing. You don\u2019t need to spend time making those parts look good. Although I should say that I want to make sure that certain things are always consistent. For example, if I need to enter a date, I should always enter it the same way, like through a calendar selector or something. I don\u2019t want it to be possible to enter dates in different ways. Same goes for things like the car year. I don\u2019t want to accidentally type 2117 as a car year. And I\u2019m probably never going to buy a car for my lot older than 1990. Oh, and one more thing, just make sure things are labeled. I don\u2019t want to end up typing a car\u2019s model in the make box.\n\n# Business rules\nThis project has few business rules that are implemented at both front-end using jQuery and back-end using FluentValidations.\n\n* If inventory status = Sold then Sale price and Sale date are mandatory. otherwise they are optional.\n* If repair description and repair cost is not entered then display an alert notifying the user that \"are you sure you dont want to enter repair details?\". if user selects yes then allow user to proceed\n* If repair cost or repair description is entered then the other field is mandatory\n* If repair description is entered then repair cost should be greater than 0\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the Car Make drop down then 'New car make' field is mandaotory\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the Car Model drop down then 'New car model' field is mandaotory\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the Car Trim drop down then 'New car trim' field is mandaotory\n* Year is mandatory\n* Km is mandaotory and should be between 1 and 500000\n* Rego number is mandatory\n* Rego expiry date is mandatory\n* Transmission type is mandatory\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the Color drop down then 'New car color' field is mandaotory\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the BodyType drop down then 'New body type' field is mandaotory\n* No of seats is mandatory and should be between 1 and 10\n* No of cylinders is mandatory and should be between 1 and 10\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the DriveType drop down then 'New drive type' field is mandaotory\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the FuelType drop down then 'New fuel type' field is mandaotory\n* Description is multi line and is mandatory. should be between 1 and 1000\n* Purchase price is mandatory and should be between 1 and 100000\n* If user selected 'Add new..\" from the PurchaseType drop down then 'New purchase type' field is mandaotory\n* Lot date is required\n* Sale price must be at least \"purchase price + repair cost + 500\"\n* InventoryStatus is mandatory\n\n\n# Techskills Used\n\n* .Net Core\n* MVC\n* Razor Views\n* xUnit Tests\n* JavaScript\n* jQuery Plugins for Form Wizard, Image uploads and validations\n* Fluent Validations\n* Automapper\n\n\n# How to set it up locally\n\n* You need to have Visual studio 2019 installed with .Net Core SDK\n\n* You need to have a SQL Server installed on local machine.

Throughout the game logic, you will find _"TODO"_ comments that must be completed in order for the game to work. You are going to use the asynchronous skills you gained in the course to fill in the blanks in this game.\n\nThe game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players\' rankings.\n\nThe game has three main views:\n\n1. The form to create a race\n\n2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)\n\n3. The race results view\n\n## Starter Code\n\nWe have supplied you with the following:\n\n1. An API. The API is provided in the form of a binary held in the bin folder. You never need to open the binary file, as there are no edits you can make to it. Your work will be 100% in the front end.\n\n2. HTML Views. The focus of this course is not UI development or styling practice, so we have already provided you with pieces of UI, all you have to do is call them at the right times.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIn order to build this game, we need to run two things: the game engine API and the front end.\n\n### Start the Server\n\nThe game engine has been compiled down to a binary so that you can run it on any system. Because of this, you cannot edit the API in any way, it is just a black box that we interact with via the API endpoints.\n\nTo run the server, locate your operating system and run the associated command in your terminal at the root of the project.\n\n| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |\n| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |\n| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |\n\nIf you are on an older OS and the above command doesn\'t run for you - or if you know that you are running a 32bit system - add `-32` to the end of the file name. For reference, here are the same commands but for a 32-bit system.\n\n| 32 Bit Systems Only!  | Command to start the API                                     |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx-32`   |\n| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-32.exe`   |\n| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux-32` |\n\nNote that this process will use your terminal tab, so you will have to open a new tab and navigate back to the project root to start the front end.\n\n### Start the Frontend\n\nFirst, run your preference of `npm install && npm start` or `yarn && yarn start` at the root of this project. Then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000.\n\n## Project Requirements\n\nThis starter code base has directions for you in `src/client/assets/javascript/index.js`. There you will be directed to use certain asynchronous methods to achieve tasks. You will know you\'re making progress as you can play through more and more of the game.\n\n### API Calls\n\nTo complete the project you must first create the calls to the API. These will all be fetch requests, and all information needed to create the request is provided in the instructions. The API calls are all at the bottom of the file: `src/client/assets/javascript/index.js`.\n\nBelow are a list of the API endpoints and the shape of the data they return. These are all of the endpoints you need to complete the game. Consult this information often as you complete the project:\n\n[GET] `api/tracks`\nList of all tracks\n\n- id: number (1)\n- name: string ("Track 1")\n- segments: number[]([87,47,29,31,78,25,80,76,60,14....])\n\n[GET] `api/cars`\nList of all cars\n\n- id: number (3)\n- driver_name: string ("Racer 1")\n- top_speed: number (500)\n- acceleration: number (10)\n- handling: number (10)\n\n[GET] `api/races/${id}`\nInformation about a single race\n\n- status: RaceStatus ("unstarted" | "in-progress" | "finished")\n- positions object[] ([{ car: object, final_position: number (omitted if empty), speed: number, segment: number}])\n\n[POST] `api/races`\nCreate a race\n\n- id: number\n- track: string\n- player_id: number\n- cars: Cars[] (array of cars in the race)\n- results: Cars[] (array of cars in the position they finished, available if the race is finished)\n\n[POST] `api/races/${id}/start`\nBegin a race\n\n- Returns nothing\n\n[POST] `api/races/${id}/accelerate`\nAccelerate a car\n\n- Returns nothing\n\nTo complete the race logic, find all the TODO tags in index.js and read the instructions.\n\n\n### Future enhancements\n-  use WebSockets to allow for multiplayer functionality.\n- Show a race completion percentage while the race runs.\n- The leaderboard as a table is a little boring. Create a more entertaining way to display the information! You could try animating some little cars.\n- This is a game, it should be testable! Try adding tests to cover the basic functionality.\n',"landing-page":"# Landing Page Project\n\n## About the project\n\nThis project is about building an interactive landing page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\n\nIt has primariliy following key features achieved through plain JavaScript.\n  - Programmatically builds navigation based on number of sections\n  - Scrolls to anchors from navigation using smooth scroll animation\n  - Highlights section in viewport upon scrolling using css animation\n  - Highlights the menu option for the section currently in viewport\n\n## Technology used\n\n- HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript :satisfied:\n\n## Optimisation\n\nOptimisation for DOM updates is achieved using conditional rendering and custom events. For example, when user scrolls, scroll handler calculates which section is on the viewport and then updates the application state. Inside, application state function a decision is taken whether to request for DOM update or not.\n\n### Application state object\n\nApplication state looks like below where it keeps track of what is currently active section, previsouly active section and a function that will update the state and request DOM update via `updateActiveSectionEvent` if a condition is met for it.\n\nNote: It is important to set state via `setActiveSection` function only else DOM render will not trigger. (kind of like React! :smiley:)\n\n```\nconst APP_STATE = {\n    current_active_sectionId: null,\n    previous_active_sectionId: null,\n    setActiveSection(sectionId) {\n        //1. check for correctness\n        if(sectionId && typeof sectionId === 'string') {\n            //2. check if the state changed\n            if(sectionId !== this.current_active_sectionId) {\n                this.previous_active_sectionId = this.current_active_sectionId;\n                this.current_active_sectionId = sectionId;\n\n                //create and dispatch the event to update active section\n                const updateActiveSectionEvent = new Event('update-active-section');\n                document.dispatchEvent(updateActiveSectionEvent);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n```\n\nAlso, in order to minimise `run-to-completion` code and thus blocking the single thread, custom events are used to modularise code and to use JavaScript's asynchrnous nature such as event queue.\n\n## How to run locally\n- install a npm package `live-server` on your machine.\n- clone this repo and download on your machine\n- install VS CODE\n- add this repo to VS CODE\n- open terminal in VS CODE\n- type `live-server`\n- Now, project can be run in your browser using localhost.\n\n## Screenshots\n![](/github-readme-images/landing-page/1.png)\n\n## Further updates\n- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.\n- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load). setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.\n- Add a scroll to top button on the page that\u2019s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.\n- Update/change the design/content.\n- Make sections collapsible.","blog-template":"# Personal Blog Website\n\nThis is the 1st project as part of Udacity Frontend Nanodegree 2020.

Enjoy the game!\n\n## About the project\nThis project is a browser based card matching game that has cool animations, game logic and engaging interactions. It is done using jQuery and JavaScript with bit of help from Bootstrap, Animate.css and FontAwesome library. It also supports mobile first responsive design where layout adapts based on screensize. It achieves this through Grid layout and media queries.\n\n### How the Game Works\nThe game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!\n\n### Each turn:\n\nThe player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.\nThe player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.\nIf the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.\nIf the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.\nThe game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.\n\n### Game Functionality\nThe game has following interactions purely implemented using jQuery and JavaScript. Game also has very nice animations that is triggered when any of the following events happen.\n\nFlipping cards\ncards match\ncards do not match\nWhen the game finishes by matching all cards\n\n### Cool features\nGame has following cool features.\n- Game keeps track of time\n- Game keeps track of total number of moves\n- Game has the logic to give stars based on total number of moves player made before winning. lesser number of moves result in higher stars.\n- Game has some validations where user can not click on cards when animation is on.\n- User gets nice and engaging modal screen with message "Congratulations! You won!" with some vital game stats.\n\n# Dependancies\nThis project uses following libraries.\n- jQuery\n- Bootstrap\n- Animate.css (http://daneden.me/animate)\n- Font Awesome\n\n# Project Specifications\n## Memory Game Logic\n\nThe game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.\n\n## Congratulations Popup\n\nWhen a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.\n\n## Restart Button\n\nA restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.\n\n## Star Rating\n\nThe game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player\'s performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1).\n\nThe number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point.\n\n## Timer\n\nWhen the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.\n\n## Move Counter\n\nGame displays the current number of moves a user has made.\n\n## Styling\n\nApplication uses CSS to style components for the game.\n\n## Usability\n\nAll application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.\n\n\n',"a_random_quote_generator-v1":"# About the project\n## A Random Quote Generator\nThis is the 1st project for Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript techdegree program.

Note: It will still make calls for vidoes and reviews as they are not cached in the database.\n\nVerify that movie details, trailers and reviews are loading correctly for a given movie id.\n\nVerify that pagination works on reviews call.\n\nVerify the UI layout for all screens.\n\nuse the app for a while with different execution paths , check debug logs and make sure app doesn\'t crash.\n\nVerify error cases for empty state, network down, network error.\n\nVerify progress bar is shown and gets hidden at right time.\n\nVerify on roation, app doesn\'t crash and state is preserved.\n\n\n\n\n# Project specifications:\n\n### User Interface - Layout\n   \n\nUI contains an element (e.g., a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.\n\nMovies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.\n\nUI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.\n\nMovie Details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.\n\nMovie Details layout contains a section for displaying trailer videos and user reviews.\n\n\n\n### User Interface - Function\n   \n\n\nWhen a user changes the sort criteria (most popular, highest rated, and favorites) the main view gets updated correctly.\n\nWhen a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.\n\nWhen a trailer is selected, app uses an Intent to launch the trailer.\n\nIn the movies detail screen, a user can tap a button (for example, a star) to mark it as a Favorite. Tap the button on a favorite movie will unfavorite it.\n\n\n\n### Network API Implementation\n   \n\n\nIn a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.\n\nApp requests for related videos for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/videos endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.\n\nApp requests for user reviews for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/reviews endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.\n\n\n\n### Data Persistence\n    \n\nThe titles and IDs of the user\u2019s favorite movies are stored using Room and are updated whenever the user favorites or unfavorites a movie. No other persistence libraries are used.\n\n\nWhen the "favorites" setting option is selected, the main view displays the entire favorites collection based on movie ids stored in the database.\n\n\n### Android Architecture Components\n\nDatabase is implemented using Room. No other persistence libraries are used.\n\nDatabase is not re-queried unnecessarily. LiveData is used to observe changes in the database and update the UI accordingly.\n\nDatabase is not re-queried unnecessarily after rotation. Cached LiveData from ViewModel is used instead.\n\n### Bonus features\nExtend the favorites database to store the movie poster, synopsis, user rating, and release date, and display them even when offline.\n\nImplement sharing functionality to allow the user to share the first trailer\u2019s YouTube URL from the movie details screen.\n\n# Tasks done \nbranch off current codebase\n\nconvert list view to recycle view so that in future pagination library can be used\n\ninstead of image poster, display title in a textview during refactoring for faster testing\n\nimplement repository, view model and live data pattern to fetch data in pages and update the UI. only update the title for now. - Done\n\nimplement Room database by defining entities and DAO. include only id and title of the movie at this stage.\n\nimplement detail screen which only displays title with a favourite button. click on button will make entry in favourites table. \n\ndelete a favourite movie item from database when user taps on the button again in detail screen. (In OnCreate(), find out if movie is favourite and update the button likewise).\n\nput APIKEY in the grade.properties file and exclude that file from commit\n\nimplement tabbed view on details screen. first tab shows details, second tab shows trailers and third tab shows reviews.\n\nimplement additional calls in detail layout that shows reviews. \n\nimplement additional calls in detail layout that shows trailers. \n\nhandle for network errors such as 500, down etc.\n\nhandle empty state on all service calls and display text message accordingly.\n\nhandle paging validations\n\nput progress bar\n\nwhen activity / fragment calls onResume, check the status code and display accordingly.\n\nput intent on trailer to open it on youtube\n\nput back preferences code and test with existing preferences. check correct calls are being made.\n\nadd favourites option in preferences and implement it.\n\nbug - page no. is not reseting when user changes between high popular to top rating:fixed\n\nuse constraints layout instead of relative layout for better performance.\n\nImplement sharing functionality to allow the user to share the first trailer\u2019s\xa0YouTube\xa0URL from the movie details screen.\n\nput back grid layout with images and detail layout shows data as specified.\n\nuse data binding in detail screen to bind data to views.\n\n',Miwok:"Miwok App - Android!\n===================================\n\nThis app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language.\nDeveloped as part of Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree.\n\nPre-requisites\n--------------\n\n- Android SDK v23\n- Android Build Tools v23.0.2\n- Android Support Repository v23.3.0\n\n# Skills gained\nLearnt more about Android , Java and Audio API along with layout techniques.\n",Calculator:"# Project - Calculator for Android!\nThis is the simple calculator app for Android written in Java. It supports adaptive layouts for portrait and landscape modes using Constraint Layouts. It also preserves the state by saving it to the bundle during screen config change.\n\n# How to run this project\n1. Download this repo to your local or clone it using this link: https://github.com/dilipagheda/Calculator.git\n2. Open the project in Android Studio.\n3. Compile and run in any emulator of your choice.\n4. If you wish, You can also run it on physical android device.\n5. Once app starts, try to switch between portrait and landscape mode and note that how it keeps the state. That's the main takeaway from this project.\n\n# Skills gained\nThis project helped me to learn more about Android, Java, Constraints Layout, Responsive layout for portrait vs landscape mode and state management between modes.\n","feedreader-jasmine":'# Project Overview\n\nThis project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It uses Jasmine framework for unit tests.\n\n# How to run this project\n1. Download or Clone the project folder in your local driver using link : https://github.com/dilipagheda/feedreader-jasmine.git\n2. Open index.html in the browser\n3. Wait for Jasmine tests to run and finish\n4. Once Jasmine tests are finish, you will see the report at the bottom of the page.\n5. Refresh the page to run tests again.\n6. Have fun!\n\n## Learnings\n\n1. Learnt how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. \n2. Learnt underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.\n\n\n\n# Test cases\n\n1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined _and_ that the URL is not empty\n    * For example, how would you use a `for...of` loop in this test?\n2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty\n    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What are you testing for this time?\n3. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`\n    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?\n4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default\n    * You\'ll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how the hiding/showing of the menu element is implemented\n    * What code in `app.js` is directly involved with toggling the menu on and off?\n5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display itself when clicked, and does it hide when clicked again?\n    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What is different this time around?\n    * Which clickable element are you checking for?\n    * How do you "simulate" a mouse click that element without actually clicking it?\n6. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`\n    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?\n7. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container\n    * How does Jasmine\'s `beforeEach()`function work?\n    * How does the `loadFeed()` function in `app.js` work? Is it synchronous or asynchronous?\n8. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`\n    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?\n9. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes\n    * How is this test different from the previous test?\n\n## Notes\n\n * No test is dependent on the results of another\n * Callbacks are used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested\n * Error handling is implemented for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access\n * all of the tests are passing\n\n',"fairfax-candidate-testing-challenge-android":"\n## Tests cases\n\n1) Verify, stories has image, headline, theAbstract and byLine on index screen\n - Implemented and passed\n2) Verify, index screen has no more than 10 articles\n - Implemented and passed\n3) Verify, tapping a story should take user to full article\n - Implemented and passed\n \n ## Submission Notes\n\n* Design pattern : \n  I have not used any design pattern in perticular as it is such a small app with only two screens.

This configuration was processed by the form engine to render complex forms using React components. These forms featured multi-section layouts with conditional logic; for instance, user responses to initial questions could enable or disable subsequent sections or inputs. Designed to collect measurement data from oil and gas wells, the digitized forms streamlined data entry processes, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. The collected data was integrated into a centralized data platform, where it was utilized by machine learning algorithms to predict equipment failures, facilitating proactive maintenance and reducing
